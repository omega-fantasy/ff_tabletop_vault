Final Fantasy Tabletop Vault

This repository captures a snapshot of the Final Fantasy Tabletop world as of the year 2021.
The main purpose of this project is to preserve as much as possible for future generations of creators and players.
You can find many FF tabletop systems of the past and present here, but even this vast collection is far from complete.
Therefore, we are very much open to ideas and suggestions on what else should be included here.
Also, we apologize for technical difficulties that in some cases (especially for webpages) prevented us from creating a proper backup of the system.
