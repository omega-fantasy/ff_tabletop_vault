# **Final Fantasy Tabletop Vault**

At the time of writing, the history of Final Fantasy Tabletop spans more than 25 years with dozens of different game systems, including many that we do not know about. Unfortunately, a lot of this hard work has been lost in time and is either completely inacessible or spread across various corners and depths of the Internet. The purpose of this project to preserve as much Final Fantasy Tabletop content as possible in this central repository for future generations of players and developers.

You can find many Final Fantasy Tabletop systems and content of the past and present here, but even this vast collection is far from complete.
We are very much open to ideas and suggestions on what else should be included here and we hope to gradually grow this collection as new content is released.
We apologize for technical difficulties that in some cases (especially for webpages) prevented us from creating a proper backup of some systems.
Note, that we only create a backup for a system (or a new edition) once, so you will not find the latest version of frequently updated systems here.
In general, we recommend the use of our archive especially for cases where you cannot find the original source anymore.

This repository was initially started in early 2021, a time during which the world was still suffering from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It was created by a small, but dedicated Final Fantasy Tabletop online community. You can find us at https://discord.com/invite/YQe2gQP or https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRPG , but we cannot guarantee that those links still work by the time you are reading this. Still, we hope that this resource provides you with some valuable insight into the ideas and acheivements of not only our community, but also of our contemporaries and predecessors.
