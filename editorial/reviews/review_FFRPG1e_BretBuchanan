FFRPG 1e review by Bret Buchanan

The Final Fantasy RPG isn't an ordnary RPG, its a type of new rpg. There aren't any new and earth-shattering mechanics or super-plot lines. The trend it and others of its kind are setting may one day have giants like WotC and WW studios looking at these new rpgs. This RPG is free, and on the net. Theres a link from rpg.net's free RPG's to the returner headquaters. The link to the Returner HQ is http://www.mindspring.com/~ufo/ffrpg/.

On to the actual game - I was sitting around one day looking through rpg.net and as I quite often do, I go through the free rpg section. I saw the Returners link and I went through the site. Its quite interesting, the mechanics I mean. Its a class based system, and you can be one of several different classes. It goes from the typical fighter, to a mana mage or a blue mage, black etc. Under the typical fighters theres different 'kits' you can play. Yeah, thats kinda d&dish, but its still quite good. Its percentile based system, you have different stats that you can put points in. Stats go from 1% to 300%. If you've ever played a Squaresoft game (and who hasn't, really =) Defence and Magic defence, armor decreases damage while encombering you. The stats and rules make logical sense, which is something I look for. The system does not emphasise combat, but roleplaying. As a fighter with its 'kit' you are not someone that just has %221 in long sword, but someone that is breathing braveness , his valor oozing out of his ears and commoners dropping to their knees hoping that he'd look at him.

The worlds now, they're the best things. If you happen to visit the returners hq, you'll see a worlds section. The worlds are mostly (all?) sqaresoft based. I, myself, *love* sqaresoft and I'd give my first born to it =P. But, the world information is very good. The information on some of the worlds, a dm could put together a *very* good roleplaying experence with the information givin in the worlds (but it'd help if the GM has played the game hes staging it in)

I do have some problems with it though. There is a lack of mechanics for some things, with the GM having to improvise quite a bit of things. Which, can be good in some cases, but not in others. Lets say a charecter wants to knock someone out, there aren't any rules. So the GM has to make a rule up, say %50 of his HP and no blows with sharp objects would do it. Thats mostly my quarel with it. I love the magic system, although no psionic system which was never in the FF world so I guess thats right.

Now, I've started a Chrono Trigger campaign with it, I havn't gotten far, but so far the system is great. No problem so far excecpt that I've had to rip off some of the origional CT. =)

Style: 3 (Average)
Substance: 5 (Excellent!)
