*** Now talking in #returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +nt
*** ChanServ changes topic to 'The official channel of Returner Games Inc. This channel is 
dedicated to the discussion & development of the Returner Final Fantasy RPG. For more 
information, feel free to visit our web page at http://www.returnergames.com/. (Hiro)'
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Genoce
<eldersphinx> Bounce a copy of the weapon lists in there, I'll scan it.
<Genoce> (When the actual lists are done, that is -- your Sword proposal throws a spanner in 
the works at the moment.)
<Genoce> I still think having a list for two-handed (ie, 'Knight') swords isn't a bad idea --
 the functionality for a mandatory two-handed weapon's different enough to justify inclusion.
<eldersphinx> Yes, definitely. I assume that the rules interactions with powers like "Two-
Hands" would be similar to the existing Hammers?
<Genoce> *nods* Actually, there's a few other 'natural two-handed' weapons out there that need
 to be addressed in the same manner.
<eldersphinx> Hmmm... just had a thought for an FF7-style character. Enemy Skill materia, and
 all the character's Limit Breaks are devoted to adjusting PC or enemy levels so that "Level 5
 Doom", "Level 3 Flare", and so on can be more effective.
<Genoce> Like the Level Down Status I threw out a while back?
<eldersphinx> Along those lines, yes.
<Genoce> Incidentally, I'd say we go with your idea for building out the Artifact Swords. I was
 a little reluctant to balloon the size of the table, but seeing as it's the single most
 important weapon in the Core, I don't think it'll be such a problem.
<Genoce> Oh, since we have some time before the main session, I wanted to throw in my two
 cents' worth for the GMG.
<eldersphinx> Go ahead - I've got it pegged as a long term project anyways...
<Genoce> Yeah, probably. I've been working on some articles on and off since we were editor
-less.
<Genoce> I'd pictured it as being a little more condensed than your original e-mail.
<eldersphinx> So what gets trimmed? :)
<Genoce> Specifically, Chapter 1 containing all the general GM advice -- narrative, basic rules
 and regulations, that kind of thing.
<Genoce> Chapter 2 discusses the basic adventure layout, including objectives, progression,
 encounters, and effective NPC design.
<Genoce> Chapter 3 covers campaign gaming, building up arc plots, continuity and recurring
 characters.
<Genoce> Chapter 4 covers the specific challenges of running an FF game, including how to
 emulate the general, much-vaunted 'e-game' feel.
<Genoce> Then there's one Appendix with miscellaneous tables, charts, etc. 
<eldersphinx> Yeah, I've scanned back over my original proposal, and it looks like my
 'Section' listings (each of which has three or four chapters) is fairly close to your chapter
 listings.
<eldersphinx> HTML probably allows for bigger chapters and better organization than what I'm
 used to, anyway.
<eldersphinx> Actually, back on the GM's Guide - one of the big things I foresee as being in it
 are rules for traps, puzzles, and hazards - things that challenge or threaten the characters,
 but aren't dealt with by sword-swinging.
<Genoce> Puzzles as in the classic 'switch puzzle' a la Emperor's Tomb (FF6)?
<eldersphinx> Yep. Lufia and Wild Arms have many more examples.
*** Captain_Vittles has joined #Returners
<Captain_Vittles> hello
<eldersphinx> Hey Blair.
<Genoce> Hey, Blair.
<Genoce> I've found a few more candidates for inclusion in the Blue Magic listings.
<Genoce> 'K. First off, any reason Clean Sweep wasn't included?
<Captain_Vittles> Same as Aqua Breath
<Captain_Vittles> I don't remember the rationale, but it's just water now.  Twister will make 
up for the loss of wind... and for Aero being a white spell rather than blue.
<Genoce> Not last time I checked.
<Genoce> A strong wind blows a wave of bubbles into the area, which burst around the targets
 for 8d6 Wind/Water damage.
<Captain_Vittles> hmmm... apparently, I made that gaff.  Whoops.
<Genoce> So, keep it Wind/Water or delete the Wind reference?
<Captain_Vittles> delete the wind
<Genoce> Moon Flute?
<Captain_Vittles> Isn't that just Berserk?
*** Hiro has joined #returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Hiro
<Genoce> Hey, Rob.
<Hiro> Yo.
<Genoce> Yeah, but you can't multi-target Berserk anyway.
<Captain_Vittles> We can't?  I gotta go read my stuff again...
<Genoce> Range: ST - R:5 E:1 V:0
<Genoce> Time Slip?
<Genoce> Actually -- that might be better as a Time Mage Spell.
<Captain_Vittles> Time magic effect
<Captain_Vittles> I had to type that 3 times.  I called it Grey, then Cosmic, then Time.  :p
<Genoce> Blair - Where exactly is 'Blood Suck' from?
<Captain_Vittles> FF5
<Genoce> Any particular reason why it's got the exact same name as one of our current Status
 Conditions?
<Genoce> While not actually having anything to do with it?
<Captain_Vittles> Because someone added Blood Suck after I made the spell lists
* Hiro whistles innocently
<Captain_Vittles> You could make the spell cause Blood Suck if you want
<Captain_Vittles> It would make it nice and different from Drain
*** cosmicjanitor has joined #returners
<eldersphinx> Euuuuugh. We want to give *that* to Blue Mages?
<Genoce> Actually, didn't Blood Suck get renamed 'Red Feast' in the 'official' FF5j
 translation?
<Captain_Vittles> I didn't base anything off the official translation
<Captain_Vittles> But that works, as it was Red Feast in FF6
<Hiro> And it sounds cool, if nothing else.
<eldersphinx> Works for me.
<Genoce> Speaking of 'sounding cool', any objections for changing Big Guard to Mighty Guard?
<Captain_Vittles> nope
<cosmicjanitor> nope
<Captain_Vittles> I mentioned the other comsetic name changes I wanted, right?
<Genoce> Trine = Electrocute, Beta = H-Bomb, etc.?
<Captain_Vittles> yeah
<Genoce> Now -- Beta... does that name conjure up any visions of fire?
<Hiro> Not really.
<cosmicjanitor> C'mon! Beta sounds cool!
<cosmicjanitor> So does Trine!
<Captain_Vittles> Beta is dumb
<Captain_Vittles> Trine is silly
<Captain_Vittles> I only called them that for canon reasons, but now we have better canon
<Genoce> Spoken after my own heart. Incidentally, if there aren't any major objections, I'm
 going to cut out the 'also known as' alternate names in the main listings and stick them in an
 appendix or something. 
<Genoce> Blair - so, what about Moon Flute, then?
<Captain_Vittles> If you really want a spell that Berserks *everybody* then fine.  Or is it 
just berserk enemies?
<Genoce> Untargetted Berserk.
<Genoce> Like Night.
<Captain_Vittles> ok
<Genoce> Now, what do we want to go with for ????/Revenge/Pumpkin Head?
<Captain_Vittles> Revenge
<Genoce> All right...
<Genoce> Blair - How are you planning to implement Acid?
<Genoce> This ties into Meltdown, too.
<Captain_Vittles> Meltdown is Armor Zero and can be cured with Esuna/Remedy
<Genoce> I thought Armor Half.
<Genoce> Or Acid can be Armor Half.
<cosmicjanitor> Will Don't Move and Don't Act be core or PC?
<Genoce> Core.
<Captain_Vittles> It's at spell level 10... it should be zero
<Captain_Vittles> oh Acid - armor half
<Genoce> Unless Rob changed his mind about it.
<Genoce> By the way, Rodger suggested beefing up the listings of artifact swords.
<Genoce> Any objections to that?
<cosmicjanitor> nope.
<Captain_Vittles> Hrmmm... am I gonna hafta add Don't Move and Don't Act into the Time magic
 list?
<Genoce> It'd be good filler, though. 
<Genoce> By the way -- anyone else inclined to believe that the Beastmaster is fundamentally
 unplayable?
<Captain_Vittles> Mindy tried to make it useable once upon a time.
*** Gooberball has joined #returners
<Genoce> Problem is, you shave away the 'training time', and Beastmaster = Blue Mage with a
 different name and functionality.
<eldersphinx> By "unplayable", do you mean that there aren't any Rages to use, or that a player
 doesn't get to control his character's actions other than choosing a Rage?
<Genoce> On account of having to spend so much time training that you end up with 'Engineer
 syndrome'.
<Genoce> The Engineer being considered unplayable until most recently because of the skewed
 time requirements for inventions.
<eldersphinx> I was looking at the "you can't control any character actions in combat" problem.
<Genoce> Yeah, but that's part of the trade-off.
<cosmicjanitor> Why not *let* 'em control themselves during Rages?
<Captain_Vittles> Then they;d be Blue Mages
<Genoce> And you still have the 'training aspect', ie: the time investment to deal with.
<cosmicjanitor> They don't *have* to be Blue Mages. They've got drawbacks and advantages that
 keep them distinct.
<Captain_Vittles> The fundamental difference b/w Blue Mages and Beastmasters is that Blue Mages
 control their monster derived powers, while Beastmasters become the beasts they emulate.
<Genoce> And Beastmasters have to spend lots of time to gain their Abilities.
<Genoce> I'm less concerned about what the Beastmaster does and more about how long it takes
 them to get there.
<Genoce> You name me a PBEM that has the week or so it'd take for the Beastmaster to go off and
 learn one monster's Abilities.
<Hiro> Not to mention what if the Beastmaster has a really high Monster Lore. Besides, it's
 deviates away from what a Beastmaster is.
<Genoce> Or one GM that would actually take the time to write out the tables required to make
 the Beastmaster functional.
<Genoce> If you use something out of the ToM, it works.
<Gooberball> Hey, this has always puzzled me, if a Blue Mage is hit and learns the bility, does
 he take damage from the attack?
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Captain_Vittles> yes
<Gooberball> ok
<eldersphinx> Oh yes. Makes learning Level 5 Doom *real* tough...
<Captain_Vittles> Reraise, an ally with Life
<Hiro> He just better hope he's level 49. :)
<Genoce> Would a Blue Mage who gets targeted with Doom and Death Guard active be able to still
 learn it?
<Captain_Vittles> hmmm... gotta think on that one
<Captain_Vittles> Death Guard nullifies the spell, so I'd say no
<Genoce> The same would apply to any Fire attack with Fire Immunity, etc.
<eldersphinx> I don't know... if we rule that I: Fire stops the Blue Mage from learning Fire
 spells, do we next say that R: Fire gives him a 50% chance not to learn them?
<eldersphinx> IMHO, let a smart Blue Mage throw up an Immunity or Absorbance and still learn
 the spell. It rewards strategic thinking on the players' parts...
<Genoce> I'm with Rodger on this one.
* Hiro nods
<Captain_Vittles> Alright.
<Hiro> Besides, it'd require teamwork, since White Mages get Afire etc.
*** Teirlap has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hey there.
<eldersphinx> Welcome.
<Teirlap> 'Afternoon.
<Teirlap> (or otherwise)
<Genoce> Night in my case.
<Genoce> Don't suppose there's any 'TechnoArcher' devotees here?
<cosmicjanitor> TechnoArcher?
<Genoce> My nickname for the Rifle-packing Archer.
<cosmicjanitor> oh. I think it's a good idea in principle, but in practice it doesn't really
 explain Charge.
<Teirlap> Doesn't make sense to me. A Ranger might carry a rifle/gun, but an Archer?
<Genoce> I figure the name says it all.
<Genoce> "ARCHER: he that uses a bow."
<cosmicjanitor> I think we should change the name to Sharpshooter or something along those
 lines.
<David_Smelser> I say make em seperate, and let the GM decide based on the setting of the game.
<Genoce> Nah. There's enough room for two missile weapon jobs.
<cosmicjanitor> One could be Mustadio-based.
<Genoce> Especially if we're giving him White Magic.
<cosmicjanitor> or....... better yet, Mustadio/Irvine-based.
<Genoce> That was Brandon's original writeup.
<Teirlap> Yes, an it actually does have slight e-game presence.
*** Teucer has joined #returners
<David_Smelser> hi
<eldersphinx> Hey, Teucer.
<Teucer> Heya.
<cosmicjanitor> hey.
<Genoce> Hello.
<Genoce> Anyway, Weapon Skills at the moment essentially = accuracy.
<Genoce> Or Hit%, if you want to.
<Genoce> Essentially: Weapon Skill does not actually equal 'skill' of any sorts. You aren't any
 better with a weapon if your Skill is higher, just more accurate.
<David_Smelser> But isn't that what it is supposed to represent?
<Genoce> And since the Weapon Masteries got chucked out like last week's turkeynecks, there's 
no additional bonuses factored into it.
<Eldersphinx> So what else could be factored in?
<Genoce> One idea that was raised is going for something like 'called shots'.
*** Courag has joined #returners
<Genoce> And nobody could understand the damn things anyway.
<David_Smelser> hi
<Eldersphinx> Welcome.
<Courag> greetings all
<Genoce> Hey, Luis.
<Courag> hey there man
<Genoce> We were just talking about Weapon Skills, how they're more accuracy and less 
proficiency.
*** Teirlap has joined #returners
<David_Smelser> I think having Weapon Skills only represent accuracy is a good thing, in fact 
they need to be lowered anyway, my players hit almost always
<Captain_Vittles> Is there a problem with them being accuracy and not proficiency?
<Genoce> If it's plain accuracy you're after, you might as well stick to Hit%.
<Teirlap> I don't know if its been mentioned, but I think I said something about wasting skill 
points before.
<Eldersphinx> Well, I'm not sure what else a high Weapon Skill could simulate, besides 
accuracy. Damage? Speed? That's a function of DC.
<Genoce> Like I said, it might be a nice idea to allow people to do 'called shots'.
<Genoce> You can factor that into Weapon Skills by allowing players to make 'called shots' to a
 certain bodypart in exchange for a hit in their Weapon Skill.
<Teirlap> Wouldn't it be a bit simpler to have a 'Called Shot' simply do raised damage?
<Courag> you'd have to keep track of what people hit what parts
<Teirlap> A la SR?
<Genoce> Teirlap - more like VS.
<Hiro> There's several questions that rise with this: 1) what would the game effect be, 2) how 
much book keeping is this going to be?
<David_Smelser> Doesn't getting shot in like the arm or leg cause specific status effects, 
Can't Move, Ca't Attack...etc
<Genoce> (1) Opportunity for additional damage to represent proficiency bonuses, etc.
<Genoce> (2) Not that much at all, since it'd be either increased HP loss or inflicting a 
Status Condition, which is part of the normal combat procedure.
<Hiro> Sounds fair.
<Genoce> All it'd take is a table with target areas, modifiers and effects.
<Hiro> Alternatively, a called shot could effect attributes. ie, a called shot to an arm might 
reduce the strength attribute. A called shot to the leg might result in a loss of speed.
<Eldersphinx> Hmmm. I see two problems: 1) Trying to convince players that a called shot to the
 arm with a warhammer causes the same effect as a called shot to the arm with a thrown 
Boomerang
<Courag> that would be a lot of things to keep track off
<Courag> of
<Courag> especially with multiple enemies
<Genoce> Rodger - you can divide that into weapon categories.
<Genoce> Luis - yeah, that's my main concern.
<Genoce> Plus the GM might want to keep stats hidden.
<David_Smelser> Actaully, the amonut the stats drop could be weapon-specific
<Eldersphinx> 2) Trying to convince players that a White Mage with a 120% Bow Skill has the 
same called shot proficiency as a Fighter with a 120% Sword Skill.
<Courag> Eldersphinx makes a good point too, what' the different between the warhammer and 
boomerang?
<Genoce> Luis - easiest way to do it is to divide it into three tables for different weapon 
types.
<Genoce> Piercing, Slashing and Blunt.
<Courag> okay
<Captain_Vittles> So would you have to start worrying about specific body armor?
<Genoce> As far as Stats go -- I'm kind of opposed to that idea, if only because I can picture 
it getting out of control in large-scale fights-- damn, that's a good point.
<David_Smelser> Actually, it does seem weird that wearing a Leather vest reduces the damage to your armor
<David_Smelser> I mean your arm
<Genoce> That's 'e-game logic'.
<Hiro> On the other hand, this could make combat more complex. The gamemaster would have to to 
figure out how much the character's armor stat for each location would be.
<Captain_Vittles> .... I'd rather leave combat as it is.  Called Shots as a role-playing thing,
 not a requirement.
<David_Smelser> It could be cool though, going for the underbelly of the dragon, etc.
<Genoce> Well, it'd be an optional rule, of course.
<Genoce> Luis - by the way, we decided earlier to add more Artifact Swords to the current list.
 Jon also brought this up as an issue. 
<David_Smelser> why more?
<Genoce> 'Swordjam'.
<Genoce> Too many professions dependent on Swords, not enough Swords to go around.
<David_Smelser> Artifact Swords are supposed to VERY VERY rare though, like unique.
<Courag> hey sounds good
<Courag> rare is good
<David_Smelser> Character should not all need artifact level swords
<Courag> give players incentive to do something other then hack and slash and move on
<Genoce> Yeah, but try the following scenario on for size: Knight, Paladin, Swordmaster, Rune 
Knight and Fighter all are in the same party.
<Genoce> (Not that far a stretch)
<Genoce> They find an Excalibur.
<Genoce> Now, who gets it?
<Teirlap> Deathmatch.
<Hiro> Yeah.
<Courag> the one who finds it
<David_Smelser> Then they have a duke out for the sword. :)
<Courag> lol
<Teirlap> Well, that's easy.
<Teirlap> The Paladin.
<Teirlap> Only one who can heal.
<David_Smelser> Or you give it to the player you like the most
<Courag> bias?
<Courag> hmmmmmm
<Courag> not good
<Genoce> I can tell you as a GM that that's just going to split your players down the middle.
<Teirlap> The Fighter'd be the first to drop, followed by the Knight, Rune Knight, and 
Swordsmaster.
<Hiro> I agree with M that there should be more swords or an option for more swords.
<Courag> yep
<Teirlap> Hey, M. Would now be a good time for a new, skill related topic?
<Genoce> OK, guess I'll do the honors.
<Genoce> Teirlap here thought it might be a good idea to have a separate pool to build up 
'trivial Skills' for a character. 
<Hiro> Hobby skills, more or less?
<David_Smelser> They would need to REALLY cheap
<Genoce> Since he doesn't think they're worth wasting the points on otherwise.
<David_Smelser> cause most players would basically ignore them
<Teirlap> Knowledge skills are separate skills which add color to a character.
<Teirlap> They don't have a lot of in game use, so they get separate, 'free' points.
<David_Smelser> Well, personally I think that like 3/4 of the "offical" skills could be made 
"hobby" skills, they are de-facto anyway
<Hiro> This might work nicely.
<Teirlap> So, weapon skills, invent, would be actual 'skills'.
<Genoce> But first we need to figure out what's what.
<Genoce> What about Magic Lore?
<David_Smelser> magic lore needs to beefed up
<Genoce> It already is.
<David_Smelser> uhh, well as far as I see it, the knight abilities are useless
<Genoce> Take it up with Steiner Nazi here.
<Teirlap> No way. I am not answering any questions on the Knight.
<Teirlap> I am still bitter.
<David_Smelser> like armor brake and weapon break and such
<Genoce> Already addressed.
<David_Smelser> hmm, only reducing the attack damage by 1/3 as a 36th level ability, not that 
powerful
<Hiro> Let's do some number crunchin', shall we.
<Hiro> Lv. 36 knight, x6 DC. 3d10 weapon.
* Hiro rolls 3d10 :: 5
<Hiro> 15 Str. Typical muscle head.
<Hiro> Alright. 15 damage on the 3d10. :p
<Hiro> 15 + 15  x 6 = 180 damage. 
<Hiro> 1/3 rd damage vs. 1/2 DC
<Captain_Vittles> 150 if you cut Str - 90 if you cut DC
<Eldersphinx> Cutting DC by 1/2 is too powerful. Remember that most monsters will have 40+ Armor values.
<David_Smelser> Weapon Break, according to the rules in front of me, breaks the weapon or justs
 damage by 1/3
<Captain_Vittles> Weapon Break should cut Weapon Damage, not Damage in general
<Eldersphinx> So the difference between 1/3 and 1/2 is not 120 and 90, but more like 80 and 50.
<Teirlap> DC really ends up to be no different than Damage.
<Teirlap> Of course 1/2 DC is more powerful than 1/3 Damage.
<Captain_Vittles> DC is the damage multiplier
<Teirlap> 1/2 is a larger chunk.
<Captain_Vittles> You have to be very specific when you say 'damage'
<Teirlap> 'Damage after DC multiplication; before Armor reduction'
<Teirlap> I think you could say 1/3 DC and get the same thing as 1/3 Damage, actually.
* Hiro is rudely reminded once again that he needs to produce a MCS PDF.
<Hiro> I'll work on it soon. I have some things I have in mind to post to the list later. ^_-
<Hiro> The Active Skill vs. Knowledge Skill topic. I have some ideas on how to impliment it. 
I'll talk about it you guys want to discuss it.
<Hiro> Essentially, we'd split the skills into active skills (skills that do stuff) and 
knowledge skills (skills that grant knowledge). I think overall the idea will work well, but
 there's going to be some bumps along the way. For one, what about the current skill line-up?
 Scholastic skill will be nearly devestated by the move to Knowledge skills. Also, there are 
other cases where we have a knowledge skill in other categories.
<Teirlap> OK.
<Teirlap> Might want to rename those.
<Genoce> Applied.
<Teirlap> I like Applied.
<Genoce> Applied and Theoretical Skills.
<Genoce> Abstract?
<Genoce> Academic?
<Teirlap> Academic works.
<David_Smelser> Acedemic, I like that wone
<Eldersphinx> Academic is useful.
<Genoce> So Applied and Academic it is.
<Hiro> What's an applied skill?
<Teirlap> Applied Skill - A skill which directly affects gameplay, like Magic Lore or a weapon
 skill.
<Teirlap> Academic skills are color and are bought from a separate pool or points at creation.
<Teirlap> OK, so say I create a new character.
<Teirlap> Cristo the world famous Pasta Chef.
<Teirlap> Throughout the game, I want to build his Cooking skill so it reflects the fact that
 Cristo is a damn good Pasta Chef.
<Teirlap> Under the current system, doing that would take away points that should be going to
 raise my attributes and weapon skills.
<Teirlap> Cristo is also saving the world at the same time as making batch after batch of 
spaghetti and meatballs.
<Hiro> I should say that CP from level-ups can be used to increase Knowledge skills.
<Genoce> How about giving a special pool at Level Up?
<Teirlap> Were he to waste all his points on Cooking, he would surely fail, and the world would
 come to an end.
<Genoce> Based on the character's MAG stat.
<Teirlap> No more Pasta for Cristo.
<Teirlap> So...
<Teirlap> This way, there are two sets of points.
<Teirlap> So your RP skills can still increase on level up.
<Hiro> Right.
<Hiro> But during creation, characters would get a seperate amount of points to work with for 
Knowledge skills.
<Teirlap> So Cristo the Pasta Chef can make great ravioli, and still be no slouch when it comes
 to smacking monsters around with his Emeril's Pot.
<Hiro> Probably... MAG x 10 or MAG x 15.
<Teirlap> At level up?
<Teirlap> Or at creation?
<Hiro> No. During Creation.
<Eldersphinx> - suppose we give most characters MAG x 5, only, but allow an Advantage to 
increase that to MAG x 10 or MAG x 15?
<David_Smelser> good point
<Genoce> Fine idea.
<Hiro> That might work nicely.
<Teirlap> Not sure what you'd call that...
<Genoce> Erudite.
<Teirlap> Erudite?
<Genoce> Erudite.
<Eldersphinx> Do you say that or sneeze it? :)
<Teirlap> You'd only get sued by Sony.
<Genoce> Check your Roget's.
<Genoce> It's a synonym for 'scholarly'.
<Teirlap> Should I pitch the NPBCS?
<David_Smelser> what does NPBCS stand for?
<Teirlap> Neo-Point Based Creation System.
*** Demonic_Gerbil has joined #Returners
<Genoce> Hi, Elisha.
<David_Smelser> hi
<Eldersphinx> Hey, Elisha.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Howdy.
<Teirlap> I'd explain it, but it's pretty damn near close to overhauling the whole bloody
 existing system.
<Hiro> Okay. What's wrong with the existing PBCS that requires a new one?
<Teirlap> Personally, I never liked the PBCS insomuch that it simply pieces together abilities
 of old Jobs...
<Teirlap> ...creating a new, 'Frakenstein' Job, which isn't really original at all.
<Genoce> It's adding in a bit of your much-mooted Power Construction System.
<Teirlap> So... I'll give it to you in point form, quick and dirty like.
<Teirlap> 1) PC creates a 'Base' character, using a point system to set out Stats, HP/MP
 Progression, Hit/Magic% and DC/MDC.
<Teirlap> 2) PC chooses a starting Job for his 'Base' character. This is either custom created 
or pre-generated, using a point system for 'Job Modifiers' (adjustments to HP, MP, Stats, 
Armor/Weapon Usage and Hit/Magic%; these are hardly permanent, as if the character ever reverts
 back to his Base or a new Job, these adjustments are nullified, and the character's Base 
numbers take precedence) and 'Job Skills/Abilities' (the classic 'ten' progression of 'Techs',
 or Magic; Techs are built by first purchasing either a full or partial progression, and then
 using points to actually build each level's atttack/ability; Magic is taken in Full, Major,
 Partial or Minor levels, which signify the rate and total amount of spells learned in a 
certain spell 'color').
<Teirlap> 3) It is reccomended that a character keep this Job for 'life'. However, it may be
 possible later on for a character to switch Jobs, or transfer between Jobs at will. This is
 simply done, as the characters stats are inherant within the 'Base' character, and switching
 to a new Job is simply a matter of applying new modifiers and learning new abilities/spells
 as if the character had always been that Job (a level 10 Base who switches to a Black Mage 
Job automatically learns as many spells as a Black Mage who has been that Job from level 1 would know).
<Teirlap> 4) The 'Base' character, while weak in the fact that they lack an ability 
progression, is a fully playable 'Job', and can be used in several current 'optional rules',
 the Materia System being a big one. The 'Base' character is the one which grows with 
experience, and it is also the one which 'buys' a Limit Break at creation (the Limit stays 
with the character permanently, no matter the current Job of the 'Base').
<Teirlap> (Optional Rule: The 'Base' character may be allowed to equip any and all weapons 
and armor, much like the Suppin character of FF5. This would help balance its obvious lack 
of an ability progression or magic.)
<Teirlap> I'm done talking now.
<David_Smelser> When, under your system, could those switches be made?
<Teirlap> Depends on the GM's discresion.
<Hiro> Okay, how about this: what about using AP to learn job powers?
<David_Smelser> I would limit it to "At levelup"
<Teirlap> I actually was thinking about that, Rob.
*** Wendolen has joined #returners
<David_Smelser> hi
<Wendolen> yo
<Teirlap> Using AP to learn Job Powers, instead of learning them in a set progression.
<Eldersphinx> On Job Building: I think, if it's done right, that Mix-and-Match could be 
built into the Jobs themselves. For instance, the White Mage job - specify that if it's 
taken as a Main Job, the PC gets Full White magic; if matched to another Job, the PC only 
gets Partial.
<Eldersphinx> Hey Wendolen.
<Teirlap> Not much thought on that, though.
<Hiro> Hi Mindy.
<Genoce> Hey Mindy.
<Hiro> It wouldn't be that much of a problem pending on the costs. It should cost a lot 
of points to gain high level powers, which would mean the character has to spend a great 
deal of time as a specific job.
<Teirlap> A Paladin under the new system would buy Partial magic, and then use the remaining 
points for his techs.
<Captain_Vittles> All this AP talk has reminded me of trying to implement Rob's 'gain spells 
by AP' idea.
<Teirlap> AP would also work.
<Teirlap> Each level spell would have a base AP cost.
<Captain_Vittles> No, each spell.
<Teirlap> Wouldn't spells of the same level cost the same?
<Captain_Vittles> No reason for Scan to cost the same as Cure
<Teirlap> Ah...
<Wendolen> If they are the same level, do they cost the same MP?
<Captain_Vittles> nope
<Teirlap> Then you'd have to figure out a fair amount of AP to give to players.
<Teirlap> Only problem I can see is players pooling their AP, skipping lower level abilities 
and spells, and splurging on higher level ones.
<David_Smelser> You could make requirements
<David_Smelser> like they need such and such lower level abilities to get such and such higher 
ones
<Teirlap> Makes sense.
<Wendolen> well, no one would ever buy retort if it were available
<Hiro> Level restrictions would stay intact.
<Hiro> No level 5 mage splurging to get Fire 2, for instance.
<Captain_Vittles> No level 5 mage would ever have the AP for Fire2
<Hiro> Spell requirements also would stick.
<Hiro> So, no Fire 2 until you get Fire 1.
<David_Smelser> If you have the requirements, you wouldn't need the level restrictions
<Teirlap> So you have to be Level Y and have Cure 1 before you can buy Cure 2 for X Points.
<David_Smelser> the spell reqs, you wouldn't...
<Captain_Vittles> I'm trying to do it so that the only way to have enough AP is to have an 
adequately high level
<Teirlap> That would also work.
<Genoce> True enough.
<David_Smelser> Right, that's why you force them to spend it on lower level spells
<Wendolen> you could skip AP and give everything XP values
<Teirlap> There is a lot of game mechanics, etc. that would go into this, if its going to 
actually move into serious consideration.
<Genoce> Since AP is a derivative of XP anyway.
<Teirlap> So you have to spend XP?
<David_Smelser> It sounds like it already is
<Wendolen> it takes 1000 to get to level 2....  what if cure 1 cost 500 XP?
<Teirlap> Or 'allocate' it.
<Wendolen> not spend XP, per say
<Wendolen> yes, allocate
* Genoce nods.
<Wendolen> each cost could be MP * 100
<Wendolen> (cure 1 is 5 mp)
<David_Smelser> No, spending XP is more expansive
<David_Smelser> expensive
<Teirlap> Bwah.
<Teirlap> 500 EXP for one spell?
<Teirlap> That's pricey.
<Captain_Vittles> I'm basing things on AP given = 1/5 of XP given
<Teirlap> I like the idea, but I've always liked AP/JP.
* Teirlap grins.
<Captain_Vittles> 500 is too much for a low level spell
<Hiro> If that's pricey, think about Ultima- 15000 XP.
<David_Smelser> right, but if someone has to mke the choice between getting a spell and 
leveling up, the fighters will be laughing there asses off at them
<Teirlap> Considering most mages START with three spells.
<Wendolen> it doesn't cost XP this way; it is allocated.
<David_Smelser> AP is better
<Teirlap> It's kind of confusing.
<Hiro> Agreed.
<Teirlap> You don't lose EXP by buying spells under this system... You 'use' it, so to speak.
<Captain_Vittles> That's why it's just an idea now - no hard mechanics yet
<Hiro> Not to mention is used in the FF games to buy spells (ie, FFIX).
<Teirlap> But still, I don't like it. I want AP.
<Teirlap> Heh.
<Captain_Vittles> Ap for sure - no XP 'buying'
<David_Smelser> AP is simpler, more intuitive
<Teirlap> I'm guessing AP would buy techs as well.
<Wendolen> i'd hardly call it easier...  it's like adding stats.
<David_Smelser> Yes but, what you are suggesting is spending, but not really spending XP, it 
is simpler to have a seperate group of points to ACTUALLY spend
<Wendolen> but in ff9 they aren't spent, per se
<Wendolen> and they are allocated to everything you can possibly learn
<Genoce> Blair, tell me how this looks to you:
<Genoce> Acid
<Genoce> Type: Status (Special)
<Genoce> Cost: 48 MP
<Genoce> Range: R:4 E:1 V:0
<Genoce> Duration: (d8 + [MAG/3]) Rounds 
<Genoce> Modifier: -40
<Genoce> A corrosive slime splashes over the target, eating away at its defences and 
inflicting (4d6 + MAG) x MDC Non-Elemental Damage. In addition, after the initial damage 
has been dealt, there is a (Magic% - 30)% CoS that the target's Armor rating will be halved 
for remainder of the Spell's duration. 
<Captain_Vittles> That's fine M.  Although 48 MP may be pricey...
<Genoce> OK, 38 it is.
<Genoce> In the meantime...
<Genoce> 'Generic worldbook'. Rob, do you want to explain it?
<Hiro> Anyway, M has brought up that one thing the FFRPG might benefit from is a generic worldbook. 
<Genoce> This was Erich's idea.
<eldersphinx> Rob's got the floor. Generic WB.
<Hiro> The question is 1) how could we impliment it and 2) where in the hell will it go?
<David_Smelser> 3) what is it
<Captain_Vittles> By generic worldbook, do you mean an original setting...
<Captain_Vittles> ...or an Esperworld mish-mosh?
<Genoce> The former.
<Hiro> It'd be a worldbook that would be used through the CR & the sourcebook for examples 
among other things.
<eldersphinx> So the new WB's not Esperworld. (Praise Heaven!) What *is* it? Or, more on-topic,
 how do we define it?
<Returner_Engine_Guy> worldbook...hmmm...well being as we are basically locked into a medival 
setting....
<Genoce> No FF game has ever had a medieval setting.
<Genoce> Unless I missed something, and they had space travel during the Dark Ages.
<Hiro> Not a true medieval setting. FFT came close.
<Genoce> It had robots.
*** killerb255 has joined #returners
<Genoce> Rob - yes.
<Wendolen> huh?
<Genoce> Brandon!
<Returner_Engine_Guy> hi
<eldersphinx> Okay. How do we go about creating a generic WB?
*** Xuenay has joined #returners
<Returner_Engine_Guy> hi
<Genoce> Hi there.
<Xuenay> Hi all
<Teucer> Heya.
<Xuenay> Kaj Sotala, from the FFRPG mailing list
<Genoce> Hello.
<Genoce> We wouldn't need a whole Worldbook.
<Genoce> Just setting information, mostly.
<killerb255> ...then again, do we really need a default campaign setting?
<killerb255> What are the pros and cons, first of all?
<Genoce> That's question (2).
<Hiro> The campaign setting would be either in the GMG or a seperate WB. There's no way in 
hell we could fit a WB in the CR.
<Hiro> I'd rather not turn the CR into a brick again.
<Genoce> Yeah, plus what about those who don't *want* the setting?
<Wendolen> well, the PBH and GM guide in D&D don't have a setting...
<killerb255> I guess the bottom line is whether or not the benefits outweigh the bad stuff 
regarding even having a setting...
<Hiro> Depends on how much we get for the GMG, though.
<eldersphinx> I'm hoping to hold the GM Guide to under a hundred pages if I can.
<Genoce> You think you can produce 100 pages of content?
<Genoce> I pegged it more at 40, 50.
<Hiro> The WB guide is going to be around 18 to 20 pages whenever I get off my ass & finish it.
<Demonic_Gerbil> I don't think a Generic Worldbook would be a *bad* idea.
<Genoce> Who else thinks it's worth doing?
<Xuenay> Sounds good to me
<Xuenay> Me
<Returner_Engine_Guy> Everyone, let's go
<Captain_Vittles> Could be good, if it's done right.
<eldersphinx> It *is* an extra project, and one that could take up quite a bit of work at 
this time. Do we want to commit to it?
<Returner_Engine_Guy> Oh Crist, I'll do it
<Hiro> I think it should be a community project.
<Returner_Engine_Guy> That's what I thought it was going to be in the first place
<killerb255> ...as in everyone types an article?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Those can be hard to implement Rob.  THings get chaotic quick.
<Returner_Engine_Guy> as in we discuss all the aspects and then whoever wants to can type it up
<Genoce> Wouldn't that create some kind of ungodly chimera?
<eldersphinx> You'll end up with one person doing half of the writing work, trying to make 
everything fit together.
<Hiro> I'd say, we come with a set of continents, and have a person handle the development 
of each country.
<Returner_Engine_Guy> First we should all decide on a name for the planet.
<Genoce> Why?
<Genoce> Only 2 Final Fantasies ever bothered naming the damn thing.
<Xuenay> Assuming we just dont take the FF7 approach and just call it 'Planet'
<Returner_Engine_Guy> Because just calling it Earth is boring, unless thats what everyone 
wants to do.
<Genoce> Or R.
<Captain_Vittles> R... lol.  Let's not go there.
<Genoce> Actually, Era might be a good name.
<killerb255> Era might not be too bad...
<Genoce> It's a nice, symbolic name.
<eldersphinx> Era here.
*** Suoh_Akira has joined #returners
<Xuenay> Era
<killerb255> ...I'm up for Era. 
<Genoce> Hey, Adam.
<Returner_Engine_Guy> 4 Era
<Genoce> Era it is.
<killerb255> We just named a planet.
<Teucer> Sure, Era ain't bad.
<Genoce> So, now we need a central schtick.
<Genoce> Crystals.
<Genoce> Four of them.
<Hiro> I say eight.
<Genoce> Dark Crystals?
<Returner_Engine_Guy> uhh, lets focus on setting first
<Genoce> Crystals *are* setting.
<Hiro> Fire, Earth, Water, Wind, Light, Dark, Ice, and Lightning.
<Genoce> ...
<Genoce> Crystal of Ice?
<Genoce> Isn't Ice a para-element?
<Xuenay> Light and Dark
<killerb255> ...one side's dying and the other prosperous?
<Hiro> I don't see a problem with the full eight. 
<killerb255> ...and a war between who gets the prosperous side?
<Genoce> How about each Crystal is connected to its Dark World counterpart?
<Genoce> If you draw energy from one side, the other side gets weaker.
<Xuenay> Dark World?
<eldersphinx> FF4-style Crystals. I like it.
<Teucer> I likes.
<Genoce> The 'light side' has been sucking out the crystals to power their civilisation.
<Genoce> Leaving the dark side in ruin.
<Genoce> And now the Dark Side wants revenge.
<Xuenay> Do we have to have a massive, global war like this?
<Genoce> We need an Underworld.
<eldersphinx> Here's a question. Do we want this WB to be an epic "PCs change/preserve the 
world" setting, or a stable "PCs adventure and pursue their own small goals, without having 
to worry about the world falling apart around their ears" setting?
<Genoce> The latter.
<Xuenay> Small goals
<Returner_Engine_Guy> latter, definitely
<Genoce> The former doesn't really allow for many adventure hooks.
<Hiro> Somewhere in between.
<Genoce> Settings are only good if the players can make something out of them.
<Demonic_Gerbil> The latter setting would be more fun for everyone on a regular basis.  THe
 former is just a one trick pony.
<eldersphinx> Okay. In that case, we really can't build a big war or cataclysm into the 
world setting.
<Genoce> Unless it happened before.
<Genoce> Vis-a-vis War of the Magi, Dark Warriors, etc.
<Suoh_Akira> Right, M.
<Suoh_Akira> We could come up with legends along those lines.
<eldersphinx> Yes... but a war can't be used as a present-day world 'hook'.
<Hiro> Happened before. There definitely will be a "Golden age that got blown up by abusing 
the <killerb255> ....otherwise, it'd just be restricted among one set of rules, one set of 
ideals, etc.
<eldersphinx> Unless it's a Cold War style conflict - something built into the world keeps 
armies from marching on each other, so the conflict is handled by small groups of spies or 
raiders
<Genoce> For example, you could have a hollow world.
<Demonic_Gerbil> A cold war could be fun.  But we need lots of brush wars on the sides to 
keep everyone happy (ala war of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars).
<Genoce> Anybody with my hollow world idea?
<Genoce> People coming out of the poles?
<Xuenay> I kinda like that hollow earth...
<Suoh_Akira> I have no objections to a hollow world.
<killerb255> ...doesn't matter to me, as long as it's optional.
*** LordMagius has joined #returners
<Xuenay> Two sides fighting, and then monsters from the Hollow Earth come and become the 
third side?
<Genoce> Steven, hey.
<LordMagius> Mornin' all
<Genoce> The monsters.
<Genoce> Come from inside the planet.
<Xuenay> Yeah
<Suoh_Akira> Does the world in general know the origin of the monsters? Or are they ignorant?
<Genoce> Ignorant, I'd say.
<killerb255> Ignorance may make it interesting.
<Suoh_Akira> I agree, Brandon.
<Genoce> They just pop out of cracks in the ground.
<Hiro> Steve: I'm considering doing a PDF release for the MCS to hold over things until the 
Tome is finished. Are there are any changes that you've made to the MCS as of late?
<Returner_Engine_Guy> So what IS their actual origin?
<Suoh_Akira> And these monsters are, say, the renmants of the former army of Chaos? Or has 
the Chaos idea been dropped?
<Xuenay> Are the monsters just brainless monsters or is somebody leading them?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Only two sides plus the monsters seems restrictive.  Perhaps add in a bunch 
of semi-neutral parties that are caught between the hammer and anvil so to speak.
<Xuenay> Agreed
* Genoce nods.
<killerb255> I'm up for leaving it as a GM decision.
<eldersphinx> Allows gamemasters to customize the setting, and trips up players who Read Too 
Much.
<Hiro> A few factions would be a good idea.
<Xuenay> Two major factions and lots of smaller factions that are either allied with one 
side or try to stay neutral, just like with the real Cold War
<Xuenay> Plus the monsters
<Genoce> And the two factions try to manipulate the neutrals.
<Hiro> I'd like to have some type of religion available. 
<Suoh_Akira> Religion doesn't get much mention if Final Fantasy. It doesn't mean it's not 
there.
<Teucer> How can you have a church without a religion?
<Genoce> Religion is incompatible with magic, in my opinion.
<killerb255> That might be a good story issue: the incompatibility between religion and magic.
<Hiro> One idea I used to have is that magic was controlled by the church.
<Genoce> Magic replaced divine power.
<Returner_Engine_Guy> that might work too, the players might try to fight the church's controll of magic
<Genoce> So if there was to be a religion, it'd have to have a magic monopoly.
<Hiro> Keep in mind we have polar opposites as far as the world goes. Magic could be popular 
in the dark side, but forbidden in the light side.
<Genoce> Only claiming that this wasn't in fact magic, but the power of (Deity).
<Genoce> While on the Dark Side, they know the truth about magic.
<Hiro> Heh. We should call the light side Elysium and the dark side Hades.
<killerb255> ...or Black Magic could be popular in the Dark Side (practiced by Dark Knights), 
while White Magic is popular on the light side (practiced by Paladins).
<Genoce> Because of the Church.
<Hiro> Maybe rather than dark/light, the 'dark side' could have been ravaged by a previous 
war. Sorta like the Frontier from Lunar.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Why give the Light and Dark sides topography to match the name?  I'd rather 
that Good/Evil be represented by countries with differing ideals and not by how they look. ;-)
<Genoce> Well, 'Dark' doesn't necessarily mean 'evil', either.
<Xuenay> "If there was no darkness, we'd all be blinded by sunlight."
<killerb255> ...and if there was no light, we'd just be blind.
<Genoce> Actually, that's a good quote for the opening section.
<Xuenay> So, are there going to be any definite geographical or other differences between 
the Light and the Dark sides?
<Xuenay> Or should they just be names?
<Hiro> We have one of two routes. one is that one side is always light and the other always
 dark. The other is one is a wasteland and the other is very pretty lush.
<eldersphinx> For the scorched wasteland, how about damage from the last war? Either a 
successful weapons deployment by the winners, or a failed weapons test by the losers.
<Hiro> That'd work.
<Xuenay> Hmm
<LordMagius> That's got possibilities.
<Genoce> Armageddon.
<Hiro> One of the things I was considering with FF One was a war where the Crystals war abused.
<Hiro> + to build super weapons. 
<Xuenay> What if they werent really weapons, but a bunch of VERY powerful mages who cast 
Ultima?
<Xuenay> The one side managed to somehow smuggle them into the right positions the first time
<Hiro> Weapons would make more sense if they used the Crystals.
<eldersphinx> Over an entire continent? That's a *lot* of chained E:4 effects.
<Xuenay> Maybe large parts of the continent was devastated, and the destruction of the local 
ecosystem soon followed, as it had suffered too much damage to recover?
<Xuenay> So, how was the Dark Side devastated?
<Genoce> Ancient technology?
<Suoh_Akira> Always a good idea to consider.
<Xuenay> Hmm
<Xuenay> How did the ancient technology disappear, then?
<Genoce> In the retaliatory attack.
<eldersphinx> Okay, looks like we have: 1) Naturally that way; 2) Devastation in the last 
War; 3) Ancient cataclysm; 4) Reaction by the Planet; 5) Other.
<Genoce> Or maybe we go with Rob's Crystal Weapons.
<Xuenay> I'll vote for 3)
<Genoce> 3 gets my voice.
<killerb255> 3
<eldersphinx> *When* the Dark Side got devastated may also be a good question. If it happened
 long ago, then the entire Light Side/Dark Side series of wars could be an attempt by the 
Dark Side to get greener grass.
<Genoce> Obviously.
<Genoce> Nobody wants to be trapped in a wasteland.
<Suoh_Akira> Remember. We could consider combining ideas.
<Hiro> Essentially lots of destruction. Another possibility is that the Church came into 
power (if we have some kind of religion) and there was a crack down on technology.
<eldersphinx> Back on topic. I don't see any way we can 'organize' a religion in the FF WB 
without making it the bad guy. Censorship, information-control, and heirarchy are generally 
par for the course.
<eldersphinx> The one exception would be if we created an organized religion *without* a 
Western-style church heirarchy - sort of like universal Buddhism or Shinto.
<Genoce> Enlightenment-seeking?
<Hiro> Actually, that might be neat. 
<Xuenay> Sounds good
<Hiro> or Norse. 
<Genoce> World tree.
<Hiro> Hmm. 
<Hiro> Maybe give the dark side a Norse-eque religigon.
<Hiro> -g
<LordMagius> Thing is, why would the church have to be the antagonist?
<Xuenay> Well, if it is a Christian-style organized religion, then it's pretty obvious that 
it is the antagonist
<eldersphinx> Magius: IMHO, if we set up an organized religion according to the cliches of 
the style, it'd probably *have* to be antagonistic to keep its authority.
<Genoce> Remember the Magic/Religion conflict.
<eldersphinx> "No, no, White Magic comes from God, Black Magic is the devil, any White Mage 
not in the priesthood is a Fallen soul and must be purified in fire", that sort of schtick.
<Hiro> yes yes. But it depends on the situation. For intance, Mages might be considered elite 
soldiers. 
<LordMagius> Well, i'll just sumarize a point, the world had "priestly magic", many types of
 "magician's magic", etc.  One of the main points about magic made was that it is universal, 
whether it comes from a focus of (God) or a magician's own body.  It's all the same.
<Xuenay> The options as I see them are:
<Xuenay> 1) Western Christian despotic church 2) Nice, non-organized religion 3) Nice, 
organized religion that doesnt interefere with anybody
<Xuenay> I'd go for 2)
<Xuenay> Who all thinks that we should either not have a religion at all or add it later?
<Xuenay> I do.
<Hiro> If it's a problem, we can put it to a vote either on the list or through web page. 
Personally, I think the world could benefit from a religion regardless of how it's handled. 
Humanity throughout its existence has believed in a higher power. I don't think it would be
 much of a stretch to have one for Era.
<Hiro> I think today's discussion has been great and these kind of discussions will be fun 
in the future. Although, we didn't touch upon any of the really hot topics like 'what we're 
going to do with the General/Magic Knight' or 'range formats'.
<Genoce> Yeah, I noticed.
<Genoce> Anybody want to pick up on those now?
<killerb255> We might as well.
*** Teucer has left #Returners
<killerb255> I was about to say "change the subject"
<Genoce> Bit late, but we've got enough voices here.
<killerb255> So: opinion on General?
<Genoce> I'm still holding my Leo = Knight opinion.
<eldersphinx> And M aptly demonstrates that he is NOT a Leo fanboy. :)
<killerb255> Honestly, I have the same opinion regarding Leo being a glorified Knight.  
However, anyone else?
<killerb255> ...surprised this didn't become Hell on wheels yet...
<Genoce> Leo looked pretty freakish, anyway. And the redundancy with the Magic Knight is far 
too high considering the large number of sword-slinging professions in the CR.
<Genoce> Swordjam is... unfair to some.
<Hiro> and whatnot.
<eldersphinx> The General's Shock techniques *do* fill a useful role in the suite of combat 
powers within the FFRPG.
<killerb255> Leo's look is irrelevant, but the redundancy, I can kinda agree with.
<Genoce> Yeah. The large number of sword-using professions has actually created an issue in 
games where the number of swords is by far outstripped by the number of professions who can 
use them.
<Xuenay> The thing is, I like it when people have LOTS of classes to choose between
<Hiro> With the Samurai getting a boost, the General, frankly, is a bit thin. Since it's 
mostly an original job, there's not much room to take it. No new abilities we could give it
 without making it a mess. And let's be honest, we already have another Adept/Warrior job 
that channels elemental power through their weapons....
<Genoce> Yeah, the Magic Knight.
<Xuenay> I dont really mind removing classes, as long as we get more classes to replace them
<Hiro> Which brings us to what came up yesterday: moving the General's powers to the Magic 
Knight.
<killerb255> Speaking of which, since the General is a Knight, Shock should be covered by
the Knight (just the Steiner ability, not the entire command)...
<Genoce> We might want to do something in regards to Brandon's Sharpshooter. I say another 
missile-using profession is good.
<eldersphinx> First question: If we give the Magic Knight "Mad Ranged Shock Attacks", what's 
his weakness?
<killerb255> ...but first.
<killerb255> ...tie-breaker for the Archer.
<Genoce> No tie-breaker.
<Genoce> Archer gets White Magic.
<Genoce> And Crossbows.
<Genoce> That's it.
<Genoce> Well, Charge +Aim +Disorder Shot +White Magic.
<killerb255> ...it is canon with FF3j and FF4.
<eldersphinx> I'm just wondering about General -> MK implementation. The big hole in the 
MK's arsenal has always been the lack of a ranged attack.
<killerb255> ...and the General is nothing more than Ranged attacks.
<killerb255> ...going with the "change everything" bandwagon, I will say that the Beastmaster 
is a glorified Blue Mage.
<Genoce> My concern was more that the Beastmaster wasn't playable.
<Hiro> The new MCS will probably a big help to Beastmaster players.
<Xuenay> Does every class be PERFECTLY balanced? I mean, of course they need to be balanced, 
but that everything that might slightly hinder them is a no-no?
<eldersphinx> What sort of time delay is built into the current rules?
<Genoce> A week or so, possibly more. Let me check.
<killerb255> You're right.  That was my original argument with the Magic Knight.
<eldersphinx> Ouch.
<killerb255> ...but oh well: it's one major weakness is now disspelled with the General merger.
<Xuenay> A slightly worse weakness than with the other classes does not automatically equate 
to nobody wanting to play them
<Genoce> Erich summarised it best when he said that people are going to feel just a little 
resentful when their pals are firing off Ultimas and Cleaves while they're stuck with some 
crappy second-rate Ability.
<eldersphinx> Workable. Or, alternatively, allow the Beastmaster to learn a new rage quickly,
 but then require him to 'practice' it - use it exclusively - for a longer period while 
adventuring?
<Genoce> How would that work out?
<Genoce> And let's not forget that the Beastmaster requires the ToM to work properly.
<eldersphinx> So a Beastmaster who already knows how to use Brawler and M-Tek Rages, and who
 wants to learn Wererat, could only use Wererat rages for a day or so after he first learned 
the rage?
<Genoce> ...that's the general 'balance' issue in a nutshell.
<Genoce> The game should be equally rewarding for everybody.
* Hiro nods
<killerb255> I agree.
<Xuenay> I never disputed that
<eldersphinx> Hmm. If we move the General's Shocks to the Magic Knight, do they have to stay 
as long-range effects?
<Hiro> Sword Magic is still short ranged. And they have to pay MP for it.
<Hiro> And Shocks, unless we give them an MP cost, would have an init. penalty.
<Genoce> Which actually makes them more limited in the long run.\
<killerb255> I'd say ditch half the Shocks, since they're going to have enough power packing 
high-level spells.
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> Blair said he wanted to change the functionality anyway.
<Genoce> His take on it is -- lower Elemental spells are long-term enchantments.
<Genoce> Higher Elemental spells are one-shots.
<killerb255> ...that would *really* make MP a weakness.
<killerb255> Ok.  I'll take the happy medium.
<Suoh_Akira> So what? Fire would enchant the blade, whereas Fira would damage the enemy?
* Hiro ponders
<killerb255> Maybe the Magic Knight should get the choice to chant, keep the chant for the 
designated rounds, yet they can have the choice to release the spell...
<Genoce> Rune Knight.
<Suoh_Akira> RK? I say give them Mighty Sword. There's precendent.
<killerb255> Easy.  I kinda worked this out a while back.
<Genoce> Go ahead, Brandon.
<killerb255> ...the progression from Mighty Sword from the old Knight *could* be thrown in 
with the exact progression from Runic.
<killerb255> ...and it would still be balanced.
<killerb255> After all, by time they get Mighty Sword, they'll end their Red Magic progression.
<killerb255> ...at least that was true before the new Magic progression writeup.
<killerb255> Basically, keep the Runic powers at 1, 20, 45, and 60.
<Genoce> I know you were wondering whether the Rune Knight should switch progressions.
<killerb255> Keep the Mighty Sword old Knight progression at:
<killerb255> 46, 51, 56, 61
<killerb255> ...within reasonable adjustment.
<Genoce> The thing is, we could do a little more with the Rune Knight.
<Genoce> One idea I had that isn't entirely canon but might be fun is to turn the RK into a 
kind of magic dynamo.
<Genoce> Stick him on the frontlines, soaking up magical energy. Then the RK can release their 
absorbed energy in the form of a special attack or similar.
<killerb255> aka: Runic Charge.
<Genoce> Yep.
<Genoce> Only making that the Leitmotiv for the RK's abilities.
<Genoce> By bringing Mighty Sword into it.
<killerb255> Hmmm...
<Genoce> Because there's no holistic connection between MS and Runic.
<killerb255> ...there isn't.
<Genoce> It's just two separate Ability sets, and that looks kind of awkward.
<Suoh_Akira> So, MP absorbed through Runic would power Mighty Sword?
<Genoce> Something like that.
<killerb255> This is neither Celes nor Dycedarg here as well...
<Genoce> Yeah, but it's a logical middle ground between the two of them.
<Suoh_Akira> What the Hell? I'll take a stab at it. How can I improve my rep by just waiting?
<Genoce> Oh, wait. We need a new Geomancer.
* Hiro wonders if a 10d6 line of powers for Geomancers would be out of the question.
<Hiro> hmm. 
<killerb255> Probably not.
<eldersphinx> Probably not. The Geomancer is closer to a MP-less Black Mage than anything else.
<Genoce> I'd be more concerned with basic functionality.
<killerb255> ...or make it 3d6, 5d6, 7d6, and 9d6.
<Hiro> Or we could make it 3d6, 6d6, 9d6, & 12d6. Might be too much though. No non-mage does 
that much damage.
<killerb255> What the Geomancer really needs is, primarily, functionality, secondarily, versatility.
<eldersphinx> M, can you send a copy my way? I'll see what I can do with it.
<killerb255> As far as functionality goes, I'm kinda up for the old Geomancer/Dancer chart 
over the Geomancy roll.  The two mechanics contradicted each other.
<eldersphinx> Here's a thought for Geomancers - a higher-level ability called "Alter 
Environment" or something like that.
<Genoce> I think 'Ignore Terrain' is more of an example of what the Geomancer can do with 
their talents.
<eldersphinx> Basically, it would allow the Geomancer to use additional attacks such as 
summoning a storm, shifting bedrock to create a small hill or fissure, or something similar...
<Genoce> Are you going to do anything with the Dragoon?
<killerb255> The only problem I might have is that I may have made High Jump a bit too
 munchkinous.
<killerb255> Jump, land last, triple damage...ouch.
<killerb255> I think what I'll do with High Jump is for it to have the same mechanics as 
Power Jump: a CoS to remain in the air for one more round, then they land the next round 
and inflict triple damage.
<killerb255> ...failure means (whichever one of these two is more balanced):
<killerb255> 1) They land and do no damage.
<killerb255> 2) They land as a normal Jump and inflict double damage.
<Genoce> (1)
<Genoce> What's the point of taking a risk if you don't actually risk anything?
<eldersphinx> What's the CoS you'd planned on using for High Jump?
<killerb255> Just a sec, I'll look at Power Jump's CoS...
<killerb255> 20% + (Level/5) + (Magic/3)
<killerb255> ...that might be a bit low for High Jump
<Hiro> That's gonna have to change. :)
<eldersphinx> Hmm, maximum of 50% CoS. Probably should up that one a bit.
<Hiro> So, I'd say 55 + Level + Agility, Defense.
<killerb255> ...of remaining in the air?  I don't know how an enemy's defense would come to
 play...
<eldersphinx> I'd recommend the 40 + Level + Stat, Brandon. Gives an overall 50 - 60% CoS 
for most Dragoons using the power...
<Hiro> LV. 50 guy with Agility of 18 would have a CoS of (123 - Defense)%.
<Genoce> Seems steep enough.
<killerb255> This formula would work, but again, how would an enemy's Defense factor towards 
a Dragoon remaining in the air?
<eldersphinx> How Defense for High Jump comes into play: Target sees Dragoon hanging in the
 air, ducks under a rock. 
<Hiro> No, I'm thinking something else. Average monster for about Lv. 50 will have around a
 80ish in Defense.
<Genoce> That's more for hitting the target.
<eldersphinx> How well the Dragoon's jumped determines whether he can still land on the target.
<killerb255> I know that, but...
<killerb255> OH, OKAY?
<killerb255> They don't need to remain in the air for an extra round...
<LordMagius> To keep him in the air, he should use his own defense rating as he is using the
 power on himself.
<killerb255> ...they just land, and use Rodger's formula for triple or nothing.
<Suoh_Akira> But if they fail, they used all that time for nothing... It should have a mid to
 high rate of success.
<killerb255> ...not too high, though.  Otherwise, High Jump would substitute Jump for the rest
 of the campaign.
<Suoh_Akira> I say make the base 60. Hmmmm...
<Genoce> Yep. It's an alternative, not a substitute.
<killerb255> ...now for Power Jump.  That should probably not factor in Defense because the
 fundamental of that is remaining in the air, multitargetting spears along the way.
<killerb255> ...n/m.  I'll go with Steve's logic for Power Jump (remaining in the air).
<eldersphinx> Hmm. For the new MCS, does a monster have Defense equal to (Level + Agi + Speed)
 generally? Or is it something like (Level * 1.5 + Agi + Speed)?
<Hiro> No. It's Level + Agi + Spd.
<eldersphinx> Cool. So the effective CoS for a Dragoon using High Jump against an equal-level
 monster will be (Base power CoS) + (Dragoon's Stat) - (Monster's Agi) - (Monster's Spd).
<Genoce> Essentially.
<killerb255> - Monster's Level as well.
<eldersphinx> Yes, but (Dragoon's level) - (Monster's Level) = 0.
<Hiro> That's an important factor. 
<Suoh_Akira> That seems way too low. Making a chance that low will make it stupid to use the
 power.
<killerb255> I guess the Base power CoS's need to be fixed...
<Genoce> Definitely.
<eldersphinx> Here's what I'm thinking. Say we give High Jump a CoS of (75 + Level + Stat).
<Genoce> Adam - Risky, more like.
<Suoh_Akira> Why use High Jump where you have such a high risk of failure when you can do Jump
 and be relatively safe, after all.
<killerb255> Simple: you gamble for extra damage.
<eldersphinx> Then subtract the monster's defense - (Monster Level + Monster Agi + Monster
 Speed).
<Hiro> Good point.
<Suoh_Akira> And if you lose, you do no damage.
<Hiro> x3 damage doesn't seem worthwhile when you can do double damage as  a sure thing.
<eldersphinx> Against an equal-level monster, the effective CoS will boil down to (75 - Monster
 Spd), give or take a few percentage points.
<Genoce> Exactly. That's the risk.
<killerb255> ...then we can raise the CoS and/or give the Dragoon longer airtime w. High Jump.
<Suoh_Akira> How will longer airtime make the power useful? -_-*
<killerb255> ...the invulnerability.
<eldersphinx> Jump does double damage over two rounds, yes? And High Jump does triple damage
 over three rounds?
<Genoce> They can't be hit.
<Genoce> Play FF3 until Garuda.
<Genoce> Then you'll see why Jump is fundamentally useful in battles.
<killerb255> I remember that fight.
<Genoce> Worst battle ever.
<Genoce> Though it was kind of neat to have a 'Dragoon Squad' all launching one after another.
<killerb255> ...that's why Jump is so useful: the invulnerability. 
<Suoh_Akira> Still... Longer airtime won't offset the fact no damage is done if they fail.
<killerb255> That's one of the few ways the bastard can be beaten.
<Suoh_Akira> The CoS needs to be higher.
<killerb255> I guess if they stay in the air for an extra round, then it could be guaranteed.
<killerb255> ...after all, you're trading damage for invulnerability in this respect.
<Genoce> Yep.
<Genoce> I think it's a good compromise, myself.
<killerb255> Ok then: High Jump, in air for two rounds, land, triple damage.
<killerb255> ...versus Jump: in air for one round, land, double damage.
<killerb255> ...this way, we don't have to mess with CoS. :)
<Genoce> Fine by me.
<killerb255> Power Jump still keeps its CoS.  After all, remaining in the air too long with
 something that powerful (rain of spears doing double damage each round while remaining in 
the air)...
<killerb255> Dragon's Crest w. Dragon Killer.
<killerb255> Then again, would that be all that bad: double damage to a dragon w. the Dragon
 Killer advantage?
<killerb255> = quad damage?
<killerb255> ...okay...that *can* be bad...
<killerb255> ...but then again, the ability isn't gained until 64th level.
<Genoce> Seems a bit redundant, really.
<killerb255> Hmmm...10d6 + Magic x MDC...it could be redundant.
<killerb255> ...against a Dragon, it's useful.  Against anything else, just jump.
<Genoce> And how many Dragons is the average PC going to face?
<killerb255> ...true.
<killerb255> Let's see: other options:
<killerb255> 1) Use the e-game formula.  Again, that goes back to how many dragons the player
 will face, since that formula
<killerb255> ...is 250 x Dragons killed.
<killerb255> 2) Throw Dragon Breath back in.  It targetted groups of enemies, however, it's
 basically Minus Strike with the enemy's HP instead of your own.
<killerb255> ...which can be horribly munchkinous.
<Hiro> That'd be pretty nasty for a boss fight.
<killerb255> Hmmm...maybe a way to balance it could be 1/2 the enemy's missing HP...
<Hiro> Might be a good way to handle it. At least against a boss.
<killerb255> ...the targetting in FF9 was weird, though.  It targetted groups of enemies.  If
 you fought 20 chocobos, 1 behemoth, and 3 tonberries,
<killerb255> ...you could target the 20 chocobos, the 1 behemoth, or the 3 tonberries.
<killerb255> ...or maybe drop this property altogether and restrict it to single targets...
<Genoce> I think that might be advisable.
<killerb255> ...or a multitarget range of R:3 E:2 V:1 or something...
<killerb255> Heh, that's the first time the Dragoon received more treatment than the Thief
 since 2.0. :)
<Genoce> Speaking of the Thief, are we still doing the Robber's Evidence/Thievery swap?
<killerb255> Yeah.  The name Thievery is so misleading.
<Genoce> Sounds like an advanced 'Steal'.
<killerb255> It'll be named "Robber's Evidence (Thievery)"
<killerb255> RE was the Japanese name.
<killerb255> ...so it's canon.
<Genoce> Yep.
<killerb255> I thought about having Steal-All become X-Steal, working like Quadra Slam or
 Disorder Shot, but it really doesn't matter either way.
*** Demonic_Gerbil has joined #returners
<killerb255> Probably few.
<Demonic_Gerbil> People are still here.  Wow.  :p
<Genoce> Yeah, we're still truckin'.
<Xuenay> Of course we are, it's only nearing 7 am
<Hiro> I need to find a place to stick descriptions for the monster power categories.
<Genoce> Unless anybody's got any clever ideas for the Beastmaster.
<killerb255> ...should we save the Mimic and the Gambler for another session?
<Genoce> Mimic Blair already resolved.
<Genoce> Gambler... uh, I've been tinkering with. It'll be done. Eventually.
<killerb255> What was his solution?  I didn't check the message boards to find out.
<Genoce> They only mimic one action at a time.
<killerb255> Is that their only Job power?
<Genoce> Apparently.
<killerb255> ...if so, that might be rather weak, especially if the Mimic is solo.
<killerb255> ...which might be a bad idea for any Mimic anyway. :)
<Genoce> The Mimic is pure group player.
<killerb255> I do remember you guys discussing the ability Gogo had: to use other powers as 
his own.
<killerb255> ...the FF5 Mimic had that, in a way, as well.
<killerb255> ...but I think it may have been deemed munchkinous.
<Genoce> Yes, it was.
*** Captain_Vittles has joined #Returners
<Genoce> There's Blair.
<Suoh_Akira> WB, Blair.
<killerb255> Mimicking *one* ability may be enough to balance them, since the Mimic is *only*
 able to mimic the last action.
<Captain_Vittles> Hey
<killerb255> Speak of the devil. :)
<Genoce> And here's me thinking we were winding down again. We're talking about the Mimic.
<Genoce> Or Mime.
<Suoh_Akira> Blair, could you tell me your current lineup for MK/General Shocks?
<Suoh_Akira> Which ones go which ones stay?
<Captain_Vittles> I haven't looked at MK yet.
<Captain_Vittles> I can't believe this is still going on.
<Captain_Vittles> M... isn't it morning for you now?
<Genoce> I'm enjoying the sunset.
*** Jared has joined #returners
<Genoce> Now that's timing.
<eldersphinx> Yo, Jared.
<Genoce> Hey, Jared.
<Xuenay> Hi there... You're a little late.
<Jared> Any really big flamewars?  
<Captain_Vittles> no
<Hiro> Nope. :(
<Genoce> Yeah, we're just getting down to deciding how to edit the log.
*** Trunks has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hi, Dustin.
<Genoce> Blair -- you're on the half of the magic I'm not doing.
<Genoce> Adam -- You've got the Rune Knight.
<Genoce> Brandon -- Getting the Dragoon overhauls.
<killerb255> ...and the Thief corrections.
<Genoce> By the way, Dustin -- how's the FFIX WB coming?
<Suoh_Akira> I'll try and have a rough draft done soon.
<Genoce> Rodger -- you wanted to do the Artifact Swords?
<eldersphinx> Can do.
<Agentrolf> I've got most of the Mist continent done
<Agentrolf> But i've run into a rut with the Magic stone ability system
<eldersphinx> Who wants to float the Academic/Applied skill split to the list?
<Captain_Vittles> Adam - if you're doing the Rune Knight, then I'll worry about the Magic
 Knight.
<Genoce> That's Rob's Job, I think.
<Genoce> Jared -- do you want to revise the Beastmaster?
<Jared> Sure.
<Genoce> The functionality's still broken because of the long training period. See if you 
can't find a way to make it playable.
<Jared> Long training period, eh?  Anything else that needs changing?  
<Genoce> You can base it off the rewrite I submitted to the list.
<eldersphinx> I can tackle some ideas on a Geomancer remake.
<Jared> IOW, how the abilities that actually function in combat?  
<Genoce> Yeah, and how they're obtained.
<Genoce> Those are the two main bugbears.
<Jared> Genoce: Send it to bmilne@agt.net so I can have a look at it.  
<Genoce> It should still be in the list archives...
<Genoce> But OK.
<Teirlap> And I could take something minor if needed.
<Genoce> Do you want to tackle the targeting tables?
<Teirlap> For Called Shots?
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Teirlap> How hard is that?
<Genoce> Uh... it'll take some doing.
<Teirlap> I could probably come up with one right now off the top of my head.
<Teirlap> The NPBCS is making progress however.
<Teirlap> I'm still in the 'sorting' phase: Determining which current Job powers are somewhat
 standard, and which are just plain off the wall strange.
<Teirlap> I.E. Charge, Draw Out, Rage...
<Genoce> OK. Let me know when you're ready to beta.
<Teirlap> Sure thing.
<Genoce> Need to hard reset and work on a transcript.
