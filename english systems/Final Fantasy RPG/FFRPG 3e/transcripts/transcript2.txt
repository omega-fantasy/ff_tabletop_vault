<eldersphinx> M: Should the Knight Swords be on the agenda? Is there anything you'd like to
 pitch on them, or would you rather wait until you have a write-up?
<Genoce> I had a writeup, but your Artifact Swords put a few holes in it.
<Genoce> That, and I was busy finishing up the new Blue Magic and Explosives listings.
<eldersphinx> Explosives? For the Chemist?
<Genoce> No, for everybody.
<Genoce> I ripped the first four entries out of the One-Shot Items table and stuck them under
 Weapons instead.
<eldersphinx> Huh... well, it sounds to me like there's not much that can be discussed on
 Knight Swords - people can't pitch ideas, because you've already thought of them, and can't
 comment on what you've written, because it isn't done yet.
* Genoce nods.
<Genoce> Unless people are willing to consider a third list of 'light Swords'?
<eldersphinx> Do we have the weapons to make a complete list? IIRC, a lot of the 'sabre'
 weapons are already in the Swords list.
<Genoce> Yeah, but I've gone ahead and compiled a listing of every sword in the e-games,
 period. 
<Genoce> Lessee here: with 67 weapons in the e-games, I think we've got enough grounds.
<eldersphinx> Hmmm... would 'light Sword' be considered a different weapon skill from regular
 Swords in FF? (I'm assuming d8 damage dice?)
<Genoce> I pegged two-handeds as d12, so yes.
<Genoce> d8 puts them on par with Ninja Knives, though.
<Genoce> Means that there's got to be something in the functionality.
<eldersphinx> Well, what I'm wondering is how/why the light Swords get a different weapon
 skill.
<Genoce> They wouldn't.
<eldersphinx> Then why make them a different weapon class? Just make a note that some lighter
 Sword types use a d8, and put them on the Swords page.
<Genoce> Because you can play around with the functionality behind it. Add in a special rule to
 represent the lighter weight and flexibility of the sword. 
<Genoce> Two-Handed Swords, for example, give you extra damage but prevent you from dual
 wielding or carrying a shield.
<Genoce> That way, it isn't just a different d[x] and a few new names.
<eldersphinx> The 'prevent shield use' is prob. the one thing balancing out Two-Handed Sword +
 Dispatch at level 1...
<Genoce> Interesting question: what effect would Two Weapons have on, say, Cleave?
<eldersphinx> Seriously, I'd rule that Two Weapons doesn't affect anything that doesn't work
 off of a Fight command, just as the Offering didn't in FF6.
<Genoce> Speaking of FF6, one item that I wanted to put on the agenda regarded Accessories. 
<Genoce> Just kicking around the idea that the one-Accessory limit should be extended to one
 Accessory from each group.
<Genoce> I'd also like to budget the five seconds it'd take to talk over the equipment I
 posted.
<eldersphinx> It hit the list just last night, though. Gotta admit that I didn't see it until
 this morning myself.
<eldersphinx> If it sits for another day or two, we'd probably see some discussion on it. I've
 actually got some thoughts on it...
<Genoce> Share, by all means.
<eldersphinx> Well, first comment: What exactly does a Sheath do, in terms of protection? Give
 a player an arguing point if the GM aims a destructive attack at a weapon not in hand?
<Genoce> More of an RP thing. 
<Genoce> I considered it awarding a basic bonus against Damage/Break.
<Genoce> Nothing unseemly. 2, 3% at the most.
<eldersphinx> There's an idea for the Engineer. Some kind of 'Temper' command, grants a bonus
 against Breakage or similar catastrophe for allies' equipment.
<Genoce> That's Maintenance.
<Genoce> Which already got thrown in a while back.
<eldersphinx> Does Maintanence happen prior to damage, though? I was thinking something 
proactive.
<Genoce> For the Engineer's gear alone, though. 
<Genoce> Actually, come to think of it, it's an idea.
<eldersphinx> I don't think it would break the game to allow the Engineer to grant a bonus to 
stop allies' equipment from Breaking - and it clears up that "Titanium sword from the 
Engineer" blurb in Chapter 6.
<Genoce> Ah, well. Chalk up one for the Engineer.
<eldersphinx> Second comment on the equipment: Are the Fast Holsters and the Power Sleeves 
cumulative?
<Genoce> Yeah.
<eldersphinx> Would either the Fast Holster or the Power Sleeves be usable if a character was 
Hasted? Or Slowed, for that matter? That kind of synergy could get nasty quick...
<Genoce> Wouldn't Haste or Slow override all other Initiative-enhancing mechanics anyway?
<Genoce> Besides, it's only for the first Round.
<Genoce> You can't actually cast Haste at the start of the battle unless you've got an 
Accessory or Weapon that casts it on you automatically.
<eldersphinx> Anyway, the chances of getting an 8 or better on your Initiative roll are 30%. 
With a Fast-Draw Holster, that chance goes up to better than 50%.
<eldersphinx> Allowing that kind of certainty to stack with Haste is something I'm not too keen 
on.
<Genoce> If everybody considers it such a bad idea, I'll just throw it out again.
<eldersphinx> For a 2500 GP Rare item, it's not bad. I just don't want it adding to every other 
ability in the bleedin' universe. :)
<eldersphinx> Last comment: The Sniper Sight. Is this still considered an Accessory? Also, is 
the 'base 100% Fight' chance fair?
<Genoce> (A) No, since it's something you could picture being commonplace in higher-tech areas. 
See FF8. 
<Genoce> (B) That's exactly what the original writeup said, in as many words. They just said it 
'hit automatically', or something to that effect.
<eldersphinx> IIRC, Defense never factored into the Sniper Sight. You just hit with it. And I 
*know* the last time it was revised was back when MCS monsters were lucky to have a Defense in 
the mid-thirties...
<Genoce> It seems like the less cheap alternative. 
<Genoce> I'd rather not have players running around with laser-guided weapons, especially if 
there are modifiers for ranges and such.
<Genoce> That creates a big problem with your LOS suggestion. 
<Genoce> 'Let's hit a target two kilometers away! With my Sniper Sight, I can't miss even 
though it's the size of a pinhead in the scope!'
<Genoce> That's the kind of thing I'm talking about here.
<eldersphinx> That's one of the reasons why I'm wondering if the Sniper Scope should stop being 
an accessory. As it stands, if you're using it, you get no Running Shoes, 108 Gems, or Hero 
Ring.
<Genoce> It doesn't necessarily have to be magical, per se.
<Genoce> IR/Magnification can be as good as magic, in my opinion.
*** Suoh_Akira has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hey, Adam.
<Suoh_Akira> Hello Hello Hello.
<eldersphinx> Hey.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Has anyone ever noticed that a Black Mage can't use knives?
<Genoce> Can't he?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Nope.  He's got books, boomerangs, cudgels, rods and whips
<Genoce> Elisha - I guess that'll have to be amended.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Yeah, M, what classes still need to be revised and which ones are 'done'?  
I've lost track and would like a list. :)
<Genoce> Lessee here.
<Genoce> Archer -- Rob still needs to fix this.
<Genoce> Geomancer -- broken.
<Genoce> Artist -- needs limiters.
<Genoce> Bard -- heavily in need of a good blunting to take some of the punch out of those 
songs.
<Genoce> Dancer -- still a little weak.
<Genoce> Rune Knight -- unresolved.
<Genoce> Magic Knight -- ditto.
*** Hiro has joined #returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Hiro
<Genoce> General -- waiting for some kind of resolution.
<Genoce> Hey, Rob.
<eldersphinx> Hey, Rob.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Yo Rob.
<Genoce> Black Belt -- we've got to figure out what to do with that replacement ability.
<Hiro> Magic Knight/General: wait for Blair to finish his right-up.
<Demonic_Gerbil> I have an idea for the Black Belt's replacement power:  Meteor Strike from 
Zell...
<Genoce> Elisha -- I'd been sighting those as Brawl-specific WMs once I get around to rewriting 
that particular section of the rules.
<Genoce> Actually, how interested would you be in working out a new four-string set of WMs for 
the major weapon categories?
<Hiro> Why four-string sets?
<Genoce> 100%, 150%, 200%, 250%.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Could you finish the list, M?
<Genoce> Fighter -- Pretty much the red-headed stepchild of the professions, in all senses of 
the word.
<Genoce> Monster Trainer -- definitely broken.
<Genoce> Beastmaster -- also broken.
<Genoce> Engineer -- needs some more abilities to make levelling mean something.
<Genoce> Elisha - that's about it from what I remember off the top of my head.
<Demonic_Gerbil> What about the Gambler M?  I remember some talk about it.
<Genoce> Damn, yeah. You're right.
<Genoce> I keep meaning to do that writeup...
*** Maxrpg has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hey there.
<Maxrpg> Hiya
<Maxrpg> I decided to get a head start on the chat, if you guys don't mind :)
<Genoce> No problem at all.
<eldersphinx> Maxrpg: I don't think I've seen you around before?
<Genoce> You haven't missed much.
<Genoce> Rodger - he's from the board.
<Maxrpg> Someone really needs to define the damage done by those Holy Sword techniques ;)
<Maxrpg> Me and my friends have just multiplyed the damage by 1.5 or 1.6, and it worked that 
way
<eldersphinx> 133% of normal weapon damage?
<Demonic_Gerbil> (Normal Damage x 1.5) x DC
<eldersphinx> That's about the way it works.
<Maxrpg> K.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Hey, can we rename the Barbarian to Berserker?  I've been thinking about it 
and it makes so much sense to me.
<Genoce> Didn't we already approve it?
<Maxrpg> DG: Yeah, I keep calling it Berserker myself (Too much FF5...)
*** Xuenay has joined #returners
<Maxrpg> Howdy Xuenay
<Xuenay> Hi all
<Genoce> Hey, Kaj.
<Genoce> Anyway, Max -- since this is sort of 'open mike' moment right now, have anything in 
particular that you'd want to throw in, suggestion/improvement-wise?
<Maxrpg> Well, my friends are arguing about whether 01 should be a botch or not
<Genoce> Hang on, let me dig up that particular line of text from the new edition. 
<Genoce> Botches and Critical Successes
<Genoce> Whenever a Percentile Roll is made, there is a chance that the result will either come 
up as 100 (0 and 0) or 1 (a 0 and a 1). Results of this kind are called Botches and Critical 
Successes, respectively  -- in game terms, this means that a character not only passes or 
fails, but does so in an unusually spectacular fashion. 
<Maxrpg> Ah, K.
*** Herrick has joined #returners
<eldersphinx> Hello.
<Genoce> Hey, Andy.
<Hiro> Hi Andy.
<Suoh_Akira> Greetings.
<Herrick> Hello
<Genoce> Rodger, want to get us started?
<eldersphinx> Next after Map Combat is the Dragoon... and Killer B isn't here to defend 
himself.
<Genoce> Yep.
<Genoce> And the Thief.
<eldersphinx> Rune Knight, then?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Yep.  Rune Knight time.
<Genoce> Anyway, Adam, get us started.
<Suoh_Akira> Okay. Most people in this room have already weighed in on the choices, right?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Yeah.  I suggested a progression, remember? ;-)
<Hiro> I have a question: didn't Zalbag get a batch of attacks called Mind ruin or something 
similar or am I thinking of a different FFT NPC?
<Maxrpg> Zalbag, yes.
<Maxrpg> Power Ruin = -5 Attack Power
* Hiro nods
<Genoce> Though Rob does bring up a good point. Mind Ruin might be a good addition to the Rune 
Knight.
<Genoce> Particularly as that first Status Attack Elisha set out.
<Genoce> Max - we're going with an 'anti-Mage' motif for the RK.
<Genoce> Or at least, that's my conception of it.
<Hiro> That's the basic idea of the job. 
<Genoce> OK, that's 'Destroy Sword'.
<Genoce> Magic Ruin, Speed Ruin, Power Ruin and Mind Ruin.
<Suoh_Akira> Run with... Magic and Mind Ruin?
<eldersphinx> And the original Runic.
<Hiro> Lv. 4 red magic, Runic, Destroy Sword.
<Genoce> Power Ruin and Speed Ruin too?
<eldersphinx> Well, if they're ten-stringing, then they need the four Runic abilities and six 
more.
<Genoce> All of the other partials don't have the full 10-string set.
<Herrick> How many does the Palidian and Dark Knight Have?
<Genoce> Paladin has six, if you include Cover.
<Genoce> Dark Knight only has four.
<Maxrpg> I think Dark Knight needs 2 more techniques
<Genoce> If that's the case, then we'd have about six Abilities for the RK.
<Genoce> That's the Runics and Ruins.
<eldersphinx> IMHO, the Dark Knight doesn't need more sword techniques, but might be able to 
use an additional support ability.
<Herrick> How about at higher levels there attacks can dispell benifical spells
<Genoce> How would that work?
<Genoce> Hey, Despair.
<Genoce> I think Andy's on to something, personally.
<Hiro> What's Despair?
<Genoce> Rob - Despair from FFT cancelled out all positive Status Effects on one target.
<Hiro> That might work.
<Maxrpg> Hmm..
<Maxrpg> that's actually a good idea
<Maxrpg> I like it myself
* Maxrpg notes that when playing with the Paladin, it seems like he doesn't get much out of the 
abilities
<Maxrpg> Like the Paladin needs something else or I don't know
<Genoce> Max - Any suggestions?
<Maxrpg> Prayer?
<Genoce> Restores random amount of HP, non-MP-based. It's not much, but it's an idea. 
<Genoce> Hell, let's give Mighty Sword to the Fighter.
<Genoce> Perfect solution.
<Hiro> I also thing a greatsword/two-handed sword list might be a good idea for those in need 
of a Buster Sword type giant sword.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Give Mighty Sword to the fighter and you can get rid of the Weapon Masteries. 
:)
<Genoce> Yeah, it's a rather underpowered Job to say the least.
<eldersphinx> Only problem I can see with Mighty Sword -> Fighter is the fact that the Fighter 
is currently the character to run if you want to fight with a hammer, an axe, a whip...
<Genoce> Max - The way I was thinking about it, Prayer could be changed from the rather 
pathetic FF4 incarnation to a 'random blessing' kind of thing, where you roll a d10 and get 
results like increasing your Str for a certain number of rounds, that kind of thing. It's a 
wild idea, but it does keep with the character of the Paladin.
<eldersphinx> I'm not sure that the Paladin needs anything more.
<Genoce> Rodger -- It's a thought. 
<Maxrpg> M, about your prayer thing: it's a good idea
*** Kirmal has joined #Returners
*** Captain_Vittles has joined #Returners
<Captain_Vittles> hey
<Genoce> Hey, Blair.
<Herrick> Hi
<Maxrpg> M: I could write up a list of the abilities the d10 could cause
<Genoce> Max - Sure.
<Genoce> Post it on the board.
<Genoce> Anybody here want to write up a quick blurb for Despair?
<Hiro> I'll handle it.
<Hiro> Btw, does the Dark Knight get this automatically at level 1 or at a later level?
<eldersphinx> Later level. Definitely.
<Hiro> I take it there's a CoS?
<Hiro> Say... (55 + Level + Magic, M. Defense)?
*** killerb255 has joined #returners
<eldersphinx> Sure.
<Hiro> Hey
<Xuenay> Hi there
<Maxrpg> how3dy
<Suoh_Akira> Brandon!
<killerb255> I was off today, so I got in a bit earlier.
<Herrick> Is the CoS for each spell or all of them?
<Herrick> Hi
<eldersphinx> Brandon! We were waiting on you! Dragoon and Thief are items 2 and 3 on the 
agenda!
<Genoce> Hey, Brandon.
<killerb255> They were already posted on the list.
<killerb255> ...unless anyone has probs with the revisions.
<killerb255> the only problems I could see are the CoS's.
<killerb255> For the Thief, against a PC, Level should be added to the CoS because PC Defense 
doesn't factor in level
<killerb255> ...like a monster's.
<killerb255> ...otherwise, a Thief could just rob the party blind.
<Hiro> At this point in the Dark Knight's carreer their mastery of dark energy has reached a 
point where it can cancel out the positive status conditions and spells of their enemies. The 
chance of success for Despair to work is (55 + Level + Magic, M. Defense)%. If successful, the 
target loses ALL positive status conditions or spells.
<Genoce> Brandon: We dropped Mighty Sword.
<Herrick> Yep
<Hiro>  If the conditions/spells are natural or automatic (say, a regen ring that grants the 
Regeneration condition), the benefits are temporarily knocked out of commision for 3 rounds by 
the use of the ability.
<Genoce> We're using Destroy Sword now.
<killerb255> Oh, the ________ Ruin abilities?
<Genoce> Yep.
<Genoce> Mighty Sword is bound for the Fighter. 
<Herrick> What's the init penalties for Despair if any?
<Hiro> let alone what level they get them.
<killerb255> Since that makes five Dark Sword abilities, use the Paladin's progression, since 
they have five Holy Sword abilities.
<Hiro> Or 15, 29, 43, 57, 64.
<killerb255> ...same with the Paladin?  Stasis Sword: 15, Split Punch: 29, Crush Punch: 43, 
Lightning Stab: 57, Holy Explosion: 64?
<Suoh_Akira> Okay. This is my idea for Destroy Sword. Magic Ruin= Physical damage+ Silence. Speed Ruin=Don'
<Suoh_Akira> t Move + Physical damage, ect.
<Maxrpg> M: think this CoS is fine? 55 + Level + Willpower?
<Maxrpg> I chose Willpower because it seemed like the best stat because of Paladin's link with 
the Light 
<Suoh_Akira> Okay okay okay. Let
<Suoh_Akira> s try this.
<Suoh_Akira> Mp Runic. Runic Charge. Mind Ruin. Magic Ruin. Don't Move. Don't Act. Curse.
<Suoh_Akira> 8 string.
<killerb255> Sure.
<killerb255> They don't have to be stringed to the same progression, though.
<Herrick> I'd go for it
<killerb255> If Runic and Destroy Sword are two different commands, you don't have to string 
them together as if they were only one.
<killerb255> ...actually, you don't even need to string them exactly, unless the Paladin and 
the Dark Knight have some sort of pattern.
<killerb255> ...that, and Red Magic can upset any gaps in power until around 50th level or so.
<Captain_Vittles> If it's only L4 Red Magic then it's not that powerful.
<killerb255> Exactly.  It upsets any gaps in power at low levels.
<Suoh_Akira> But they get those status attacks, Blair.
<killerb255> ...that's when the other abilities make up for the lacking magic at high levels.
<killerb255> ...just like the Paladin and Dark Knight.
<Suoh_Akira> Mp Runic (1), Runic Charge (Level 45?)
<killerb255> 45 sounds good.
<Suoh_Akira> Woah woah woah... Speed Ruin, Magic Ruin, Mind Ruin, Power Ruin...
<Suoh_Akira> How do they function?
<Hiro> R:4, 20% off Speed, Magic, and Strength (Speed Ruin, Magic Ruin, and Power Ruin). 
<killerb255> How about Level/2% off?
<Captain_Vittles> 20% isn't always -5
<Hiro> Mind ruin has R:4 and does damage to MP equal to the character's weapon damage.
<Hiro> Hmm. Might need to be 1/2.
<Hiro> Kinda like Rasp.
<killerb255> ...going with the tradition of flat CoS's with the Paladin and Dark Knight.
<killerb255> How many Destroy Sword abilities are we talking?
<killerb255> 8?
<Suoh_Akira> Speed Ruin, Mind Ruin, Magic Ruin, Power Ruin, Don't Move, Don't Act, Curse.
<Suoh_Akira> The latter three need to be named.
<Captain_Vittles> Leg Ruin, Arm Ruin, Body Ruin
<Hiro> That'd work.
<Suoh_Akira> Or Ability Ruin.
<Captain_Vittles> 1,8,16,24,32,40,48,56
<killerb255> Hmmm...
<Hiro> I'd probaby move it up farther so not to conlfict with the Knight's stat Breaks.
<killerb255> Runic: 1, 45
<Herrick> Drop Lvl 1
<killerb255> Destroy Sword: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56
<Hiro> 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64.
<Hiro> 1 is Runic, 57 is Runic Charge.
<killerb255> 57?  That depends on how powerful Runic Charge is.
<Herrick> I like 8,16,24,32,40,48,56 better
<Hiro> I gotta say, I'm worried about having the Ruins start at LVL 8.
<Hiro> How about this: drop Don't Act & Don't Move. That moves us down to 8 powers.
<Suoh_Akira> Speed, Mind, Magic Ruin. Don't Act, Curse.
<Hiro> Change Don't Act to Silence.
<Herrick> So together they would be 1(R),5,20,35,45(R),50,65?
<Suoh_Akira> Well, gentlemen. It seems we have... A PWAN! ::Bad American Tail ref...::
<Genoce> Rodger, what's next?
<eldersphinx> Blair. Magic?
<killerb255> How about Blue Magic in particular.
*** Jared has joined #returners
<Herrick> Hi
<Pocky-kun> hi
*** dave has joined #returners
<Herrick> Hi
<Captain_Vittles> hey dave
<Genoce> Hi, David.
<Pocky-kun> hi
<Jared> Hey Dave.
* dave nods
<killerb255> Anyway, Blue Mage learning method: survive spell initially, then at higher levels, 
be able to see spell and have chance of learning
<Captain_Vittles> Getting hit and seeing at at higher levels are more than enough.
<Jared> I personally think Strago's methods are the fairest to the blue mage.  A chance of 
learning it by seeing it, and automatic learning if he actually feels it.
<Captain_Vittles> Visual Lore only works at high levels
<Jared> Can I bring up any questions on the beastmaster right now, or should I discuss it in 
private with M?  
<Jared> The method of learning powers seems a little confusing.  I had an alternate idea-powers 
can be learned as the beastmaster levels up.  As an example, I'll use the Bomb, a classic FF 
monster.
<Jared> Alright.  Basically, a beastmaster might not have immediate access to all the powers 
learned from a monster, but as he levels up, he can acquire new ones from that monster.  It'll 
be easier to show than tell.
<Jared> It also requires some GM approval for when the player writes up his beastmaster rage, 
so the oncus is on the player to do this, and the GM to approve it, as writing up rages for 
every single monster would be ridiculous.
* Hiro nods
<Genoce> So the GM has to police the players.
<Jared> M: Trust me, it's not as bad as it looks.  returners@yahoogroups.com, right?  
<Hiro> There's a problem here- beastmaster powers come from monsters.
<Jared> Yeah, but possibly we could include a list of rages for every monster.  It wouldn't be 
that hard-just two to four extra lines detailing what powers can be learned and at what level 
the beastmaster gets them.
<Genoce> That'd be ToM. 
<Genoce> Tome of Monsters.
<Jared> And a few sample lists in the beastmaster section.  
<Hiro> You might want to check out the revised MCS.
<eldersphinx> I wonder if it'd be possible to build a 'Rage Attack' ruleset into each 
monster...
<eldersphinx> As a part of the MCS. Likely.
<Hiro> one of the major changes to the revised MCS is that powers are no longer 'bought'. Each 
monster has different slots for powers based on the type of power, all of which are now 
organized into categories.
<Hiro> ie, Action Abilities, Support Abilities, Movement abilities, Status Abilities, Boss 
Abilities, and Disadvantages.
<Hiro> Each monster starts with 2 action abilities, 1 support ability, 1 movement ability, and 
1 status ability.
<killerb255> Should Disadvantages be divided into Action, Support, Movement, Status, and Boss 
as well, or would that be redundant?
<Hiro> If the monster is of sufficient XP LVL, they can buy the power provided they have a slot 
left.
<Hiro> There's not that many disadvantages that require splitting up disadvantages into smaller 
groups.
<killerb255> Ok then.  It would be redundant then. :)
<Jared> Should a beastmaster's physical attacks be the same as the monster's?  
<Jared> IOW, if a Behemoth does a lot of damage with its bite, should the beastmaster too?  
<Captain_Vittles> Bite is bite.
<Captain_Vittles> Just because he's emulating a behemoth doesn't mean he has the strength of 
one.
<Captain_Vittles> He just uses the attacks of one.
<killerb255> Ok.  Fair enough.
<killerb255> ...let the strength be determined by the Beastmaster's Level and DC.
<killerb255> ...and obvious Strength stat.
*** Haeru has joined #returners
<Jared> Question: What are the "inherent" abilities of a monster called?
<Genoce> Powers.
<Jared> OK, but which of the MCS classifications do they go under?  
<Hiro> They're status abilities.
<Jared> So would it be out of line for a beastmaster to acquire his monster's status and 
support abilities when using that rage?  He could, for example, absorb fire and be vulnerable 
to ice and water attacks, just like the monster.  That's the way Gau did it.
<Genoce> That's what my original writeup said, didn't it?
<Jared> Oh yeah.  Just revising the way the powers are learnt.  It makes the beastmaster pick 
and choose wisely which abilities he wants to keep and which ones he wants to forget.
<Jared> That's the only thing I'm really changing.
<Jared> OK, we'll need to tack on one small addendum in the ToM for each monster entry, which 
won't be too hard.  Someone list a classic FF monster.
<Genoce> Sahagin.
<Jared> Sahagin, eh...?  OK, that one can probably teach three powers as follows:
<Jared> 1-4 Physical Attack (1d12+3+StrengthxDC physical damage, LV 1), 5-8 Water (3d6
+MagicxMDC damage, LV 1) 9-12 Aqua Breath (?d?+magicxDC, LV 20).  
<Jared> We'll need to do that for every monster, but it shouldn't be that hard.
<Jared> If the beastmaster was under LV 20 when he used the rage, he could only use the first 
two powers.  
<Jared> And the spread would be 1-6 for the physical attack and 7-12 for the Water spell.
<Jared> Making rage lists for each monster shouldn't be that hard, I think.  In some cases, we 
can use attacks stronger than what the monster could actually use-Fire 3 for the Bomb, for 
example.
<Jared> If you want to keep every rage that the beastmaster learns like Gau did, that's fine 
with me.
<Jared> I just kept the rage number restriction from M's writeup.
<Jared> And I think it also keeps beastmasters from mastering uber-powers too early if they 
manage to nail a really powerful monster or something like that.
<Jared> You might have had the luck to tame that Behemoth through a lot of luck, but you can't 
use his Meteor power for quite a while yet.
<Jared> It can give the beastmaster something to look forward to.
<Genoce> OK. Anybody mind if I hijack discussion for five seconds?
*** Deathcrow has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hey, Crow.
<Deathcrow> Hello
<Demonic_Gerbil> Summon's Level?  When did Summoned Monster's get levels?  Or am I missing something here...
<Genoce> Elisha - they have stats now.
<Captain_Vittles> For Full Summoners only.
<Captain_Vittles> Callers still only have slash and dash spells IIRC.
<killerb255> ...but what if a partial Summoner wants a summon to perform a task?
<Genoce> He's outta luck.
<Genoce> That's what partials are for.
<Demonic_Gerbil> I guess we should get to the Artist?  It's next on the Agenda.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Uhhh...  What level will the Blue Mage get Visual Lore at?  I don't think we decided.
*** agentrolf has joined #Returners
<Genoce> Hey, Dustin.
<agentrolf> hello
<eldersphinx> We all know that at high levels, the FFRPG can become a matter of one attack = 
one kill, if it hits.
<Genoce> Let's not forget that Visual Lore is an essential part of the Blue Mage's 
functionality.
<Deathcrow> A ble mage without visual lore will be limited a lot in his choices for spells to 
learn
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> Without Visual Lore, he's limited to attacks alone.
<killerb255> Without VL, these would be hard to learn:
<killerb255> White Wind
<killerb255> Mighty Guard
<killerb255> L? anything
<killerb255> Roulette
<killerb255> Death Force
<Deathcrow> Dragon Force
<Genoce> Doom.
<killerb255> Angel Whisper
<Deathcrow> Forcefield
<Genoce> Pep Up.
<Captain_Vittles> Blue Mages should have access to better weapons than other mages.  In FF5, 
the true Blue Mages did.
<Genoce> They're essentially limited to offense until they get Visual Lore.
<agentrolf> At least a step up from the Black mage
<Captain_Vittles> Keep visual lore, but keep it high level
<Genoce> Why is that a problem?
<Genoce> Wouldn't it just be easier to lower the Level requirements rather than have to work 
around the problem with some elaborate conditional fix?
<killerb255> Hmmm...
<killerb255> ...well...
<killerb255> ...Have Visual Lore from the beginning.
<killerb255> ...but make it (typing)
<killerb255> ...the CoS low enough for the Blue Mage to not be worth it at lower levels.
<Genoce> That's a proposal I'll stand behind.
<Captain_Vittles> It should be damn near zero at level 1 though
<Haeru> ... 1% per level...
* Haeru thinks.
<Haeru> 1 or 2% per level straight out, no modifiers...
<Captain_Vittles> 2%
<Captain_Vittles> We could put a Visual Learning penalty in.
<Demonic_Gerbil> If you put a Visual Learning penalty in, you could just base the chance to 
learn as Magic% - Visual Learning Penalty. :)  Very simple formula.
<Captain_Vittles> Magic% is too easy at low levels
<eldersphinx> Admittedly, if you *could* Visual Lore Grand Train, you'd be a fool to step into 
it.
<Captain_Vittles> (Levelx2)% works, with mods on the high-end spells
<killerb255> So at Level 1, 2% max.  That works.
<killerb255> With magic%, it's be 101 + Mag max.
<Captain_Vittles> exactly
<killerb255> At Level 99, It'd be 198% max.
<Captain_Vittles> The CoS should be capped at 100%.  Then standard magic penalties would be 
applied (-15%, -30%, -45%, -60%).
<eldersphinx> Works.
<Haeru> Hmmm...
<killerb255> ......
<killerb255> ...okay.
<agentrolf> So there would be four levels of Blue magic?
<Captain_Vittles> Not all would have a penalty
<agentrolf> oh
<Captain_Vittles> Instead of levels, I'll do it on a spell by spell basis.
<Hiro> Base it on MP costs.
<Captain_Vittles> MP costs need a bit of fudging anyway.
<Captain_Vittles> *ALL* MP costs.
<Hiro> Blue magic or magic period?
<Captain_Vittles> magic period.  There's some wacky ones in there.
<Hiro> It'd probably best to come up with an average MP cost for all magic based on the spell 
level and modify as necessary.
<eldersphinx> The old MP costs are based off of FF6 and FF7 magic, IIRC.
<killerb255> How about 5 MP per level, yet the MP goes up by 1 every level.  Sounds confusing, 
but it amounts to this:
<Captain_Vittles> 5, 11, 17, 23, etc?
<Captain_Vittles> Exponents are so much easier, and better.
<Captain_Vittles> But I'll give your method a shot
<Genoce> Finally.
<Xuenay_Sometimes_Present> ...why does everything have to be PDF these days...
<killerb255> I thought the penalities were 0, -10, and -20 respectively.
<Genoce> It said -10, -10, -30.
<killerb255> ...a -30 penalty for a summon is just too high.
<killerb255> ...especially since summoners are the only Job in the FFRPG that use MP and 
Initiative penalties simultaneously.
<killerb255> 0, -10, and -20 seems more reasonable.
<eldersphinx> M - on getting SP, add one die roll to the character's Magic%?
<eldersphinx> How about using several d10s to determine the total SP pool? And upping the SP 
costs slightly to compensate?
<Genoce> How many d10s, though?
*** LordMagius has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hey, Steven.
<LordMagius> Mornin my children.
<killerb255> good evening. :)
<Genoce> Good morning.
<eldersphinx> Well... if we assume that a Weak summon will generally have about 112 SP (low 
Magic%, and a 1d6 roll), we could give it a 6d10 roll, up the average SP to around 140, and 
increase action costs by 25% across the board.
<Genoce> So where does this leave the Medium and Strong summonings?
<eldersphinx> Medium summons would use 8d10, and Strong summons 10d10.
<Genoce> And more importantly, why roll so many dice?
<killerb255> ...or forget the dice...use something else like Summon Magic Lore...
<Captain_Vittles> Lore skills get too high at high levels
<Genoce> That's why I wanted to use Magic%.
<Captain_Vittles> dice 'keep it real' so to speak
<Genoce> Yeah, but they create far too much fluctuation in values.
<Genoce> And rolling dice takes time.
<killerb255> How about Magic% for Weak, Magic% x 1.5 for Medium, x2 for Strong?
*** Adam_Is_Afk is now known as Suoh_Akira
<Genoce> How about Magic%x.5 for Weak and upwards?
<eldersphinx> That would work.
*** Jared has joined #returners
<Haeru> Hmm.
<killerb255> Hmmm...a level 27 Golem having 1224 HP?
<Captain_Vittles> Golem's power is to take hits.
<Captain_Vittles> It needs HP to take hits.
<Genoce> Plus I considered all Summons Bosses, so they get double the normal HP.
<Hiro> That explains the high HP.
<Genoce> Yeah. 
<Genoce> Bahamut has 7000.
<Deathcrow> At which lvl?
<Genoce> 100.
<Genoce> That's the formula I used to arrive at the Level values.
<Genoce> If Bahamut, at 150 MP is Level 100, then 1.5 MP = 1 Level.
<eldersphinx> Next on the agenda is probably the Artifact Swords.
<killerb255> Why do we need so many swords anyway?
<Genoce> Brandon - because a large portion of the FFRPG's Jobs use them.
<eldersphinx> A large PC party with five sword-wielding characters gets one person stuck with a 
3d blade.
<eldersphinx> No, 3d. 4d weapons are the artifacts.
<Genoce> Because all the 4d weapons are taken by the rest of the group.
<killerb255> What you guys were talking about just *now* struck a light...
<killerb255> As in "NOW I GET IT!!!"
<Genoce> If it's finalised, I can go ahead and finish my Two-Handed Swords list.
<eldersphinx> M: Move on to the Weapon Accessories?
*** miamiw has joined #returners
<Genoce> Part of the expanded equipment listings we agreed to do.
<Genoce> Anybody have anything to add to the Bow/Crossbow/Arrow lists I posted earlier this 
week?
<eldersphinx> Would it be possible to rename a couple of the Arrow types? Make the +1 arrow an 
Iron arrow, and the +2 arrow a Mithril arrow? Or something similar?
<Genoce> Well, we can go with Wooden/Iron/Samurai.
<Genoce> So Wooden Arrows do -1, Iron Arrows are standard, Samurai are +1 to basic Bow damage.
<eldersphinx> Sounds good. Max Crossbow damage would then be 4d10+4, using that monster 
crossbow and Samurai Arrows?
<Genoce> The Gastrafitis. 
<Genoce> Yeah. 
<Genoce> That's not too outrageous.
<eldersphinx> Condensed form: +1 damage to all non-artifact bows, -1 damage to all arrow types.
*** Andrew`` has joined #returners
<Andrew``> hey kids.
<Xuenay> Hi there
<Deathcrow> hello
<eldersphinx> Yo.
<killerb255> sup
<Genoce> Hey, Andrew. 
<Haeru> Why shouldn't crossbows be strong...?
<Captain_Vittles> Because Longbows are better
<Haeru> Crossbows usually need to be cranked with some mechanism to pull the string back... 
they are quite strong...
<Andrew``> I always though there should be a plain advantage to using a  bow, and one to using 
a crossbow....
<miamiw> it should go more Crossbows deal more damage, Bows should have longer range
<Captain_Vittles> Crossbows are in the end stronger, but longbows draw faster and their arrows 
can pierce armor.
<Captain_Vittles> So unless we take firing time into account, longbows should be stronger.
<Genoce> Longbows are STR dependent.
<Genoce> Crossbows are AGI dependent.
<Deathcrow> crossbows can easily punch through armor, just like arrows. They are basically the 
same design
<Genoce> That's why Crossbows are d10 and take a turn to reload.
<Genoce> The advantage is pretty obvious.
<Captain_Vittles> Oh, they take time to reload
<Captain_Vittles> In that case I'll shut up
<Genoce> Last suggestion before clearing out of Chapter 5 -- if we need it, is it worth the 
time making a third list of Swords?
<Genoce> For weapons like rapiers, sabres, etc.
<Xuenay> Yeah, why not. Variety is good.
<Hiro> Actually, I think it might be a good idea.
<killerb255> sure
<Andrew``> Can I make the weapon list?
<Genoce> Andrew - knock yourself out.
<Suoh_Akira> What sort of benefits do LIght Swords have over the heavier ones?
<Captain_Vittles> They should depends on Agi rather than Str IMO
<Hiro> Hmm. That might work.
<Deathcrow> How  about a penalty to armor or an initiative bonus? Light swords are faster and 
can hit faster and at weak spots.
<Andrew``> If it's something like a rapier, it's all about how fast you can swing it, not the 
force behind it.
<Suoh_Akira> They could give a boost to speed or agility, perhaps.
<Genoce> Initiative Bonus is what I'd say.
<Genoce> Or +1 AGI.
<miamiw> make weapon sub types in heavy to light to go with a weappon
<Genoce> Or specialisations.
<Genoce> Guns will need it.
<Genoce> Swords will need it.
<Genoce> Throwing Weapons will need it.
<killerb255> +1 AGI sounds good (+2 with more powerful weapons)
<Suoh_Akira> So what types of swords do we have? Light, Normal, and Two Handed/Great??
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Hiro> Actually, the mod should effect their skill level. 
<Hiro> Light: +5%, Medium: +0%, Heavy: -5%.
<Suoh_Akira> I dunno, Rob...
<Genoce> Rob - isn't the fact that you're using two hands to hold it already taking that into 
account?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Can we here Blair's tiamat research now?
<Demonic_Gerbil> here = hear
<killerb255> Yeah.
<eldersphinx> Right, forgot about that.
<Genoce> Go ahead, Blair.
<Captain_Vittles> Anyways, the question was ranges and bows.  From previous playing of FFT, I 
know that Crossbows have a range of 5, and nothing affects that... (more)
<Captain_Vittles> As I tested, Guns are also unaffected by height.  They're set at 8... (more)
<eldersphinx> We're discussing Blair's research first.
<Captain_Vittles> I went to End in the Deep Dungeon.  It's a good choice, as the chars start at 
height one but with Fly, then can move to height 15... (more)
<killerb255> Crossbows flat 5, Guns flat 8, ok...
<Genoce> That's pretty much the values we have right now.
<Xuenay> Because the Era WB is the only subject that I'm really interested in, that's why...
<Genoce> Which means we're back to where we started.
<Captain_Vittles> I had an Archer with a Perseus Bow (range 5).  At height 1, he only had a 
range of 4, because the rest of the terrain was higher than him... (more)
<Captain_Vittles> When he moved up to height 15, his range increased to 9!  As a side, I also 
tested damage.  The added height did *not* increase his damage, as I suspected.  But regular 
damage was enough to poach a Tiamat.  the End.
<Captain_Vittles> Bows have increased range when relative height increases
<LordMagius> Makes sense, you don't shoot as far uphill, but shooting downhill adds to the 
range.
<Suoh_Akira> HOWEVER.
<Suoh_Akira> Being higher would mean the arrow travelled further, gaining speed.
<Suoh_Akira> Therefore it should cause more damage.
<Hiro> A range bonus based on a higher elevation would be a good idea.
<killerb255> More critical hits is something to consider.
<Captain_Vittles> But only for bows.  Guns and Crossbows fire straight and have a set range.
<eldersphinx> It's something to consider when writing the Bows up and doing the Map Combat 
conversions. Probably too complex to discuss immediately.
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> Artist and Bard discussion now, if nobody objects.
<Suoh_Akira> Bard first.
*** Hiro is now known as Lucas`
<Genoce> First of all, where are the problem areas?
<Genoce> Aside from the hideously overpowered abilities?
<Suoh_Akira> I say lower healing abilities. Leave offensive and stat boosters intact.
*** Andrew`` is now known as Eric
<Genoce> And we should see about getting rid of some of the higher-level cheese.
<Genoce> Or toning it down.
<Suoh_Akira> The main problem I think is the healing powers. So let's leave the offensive 
powers alone.
<Genoce> Brandon, give them a quick recap of your Bard analysis.
<killerb255> Well...
<killerb255> If I remember right:
<killerb255> Many of the stat-boosting abilities were rather insane, which could pretty much 
justify removing a few abilities.
<killerb255> ...such as the healing ones.
<killerb255> ...which I don't want to get back into the forbidden issue again...
<Suoh_Akira> I say we lower the effectiveness of stat boosters and keep the healing spells.
<Haeru> I do not say that the Bard should not have offensive capabilities, it's just they 
usually are of a sort to more status-smash their opponent and let their allies finish them 
off...
<Lucas`> As I said earlier, the stat boosters are going down to Magic/3.
<Suoh_Akira> So let's leave the Bard alone. We're implementing some form of equalizer anyway.
<Suoh_Akira> We need to either remove powers, or implement equalizers. Both would blunt the 
bard too much.
<Lucas`> We could also limit the effectiveness of them by only allowing the effects of the song 
happen once. No stacking multiple songs.
<Captain_Vittles> The FFT bard works very well if you tone down the init penalties...
* Lucas` nods
<Haeru> Seems to be a few approaches to this... 1) Tone down the boosts. 2) Ditch the healing. 
3) Tone down the straight-offensive...
<Suoh_Akira> Tone down boosts.
<Suoh_Akira> Healing should stay.
<Lucas`> Offensive stuff I could live with out, as adverse to losing healing songs.
<Suoh_Akira> Alright.
<Suoh_Akira> I say ditch Tower of Sorrows first off.
<Captain_Vittles> What does Tower of Sorrows do?
<Genoce> Somebody got the writeup at hand?
<killerb255> http://groups.yahoo.com/group/returners/message/19952
<killerb255> Found it!
<killerb255> ...was trying to prove to Richard that the Bard wasn't just a one-trick pony...
<Suoh_Akira> Let's eliminate redudnant powers, and boost the original. 
<Suoh_Akira> Like, there are several different spells to cause Sleep.
<Suoh_Akira> Let's just make one, and find the middle ground.
<Lucas`> This song shifts the background to a moonlit tower. The target is removed from the 
battle, and cannot be attacked by anyone. This is not an escape, however, as he finds himself 
trapped in the tower, where he is confronted with his worst fear made flesh and must either 
fight that fear or escape the illusions of the tower to escape. Each round, the target must 
make a Difficult Spirit check to escape the Tower of Sorrows.
<Suoh_Akira> Does my proposal actually make sense? >.o
<killerb255> One thing was at Level 8, a couple of songs became redundant with each other 
(again, see analysis).
<Lucas`> If he fails, he suffers (4d6 + Spirit) x MDC non-elemental damage. In addition, he has 
a 50 + (Level/3) + (Spirit/2)% chance to be inflicted with one of the following status 
conditions (choose randomly): Poison, Slowness, Silence, Mini, Berserk, Confusion. For 
simplicity's sake, assume that monsters trapped in the tower when the battle ends are killed. 
Tower of Sorrows affects only one target each time it is used, and Boss monsters 
<Haeru> ... wait a second..
<Haeru> ... Damage -and- status -and- removing them from effective combat...
<Genoce> Yep, it's probably the single cheesiest Ability in the CR, bar none.
<killerb255> Aside from that, there are too many 8th Level Songs that have the exact same 
effect.
<killerb255> 'Song of the Beast'
<killerb255> ...basically the FF5 Magic Lamp
<Genoce> How are you supposed to do a 'random Summoning'?
<Genoce> There's no set list for a campaign.
<Genoce> Unless the GM prepares one ahead of time.
<Genoce> Then you have to draw up a table based on that, and roll, which could waste up to 15 
to 20 minutes of game time.
<Genoce> Random Summons just don't work. Period.
<Haeru> Too much paperwork, yep.
<Genoce> Unless the table's there to begin with, I don't want to see it.
<Genoce> End of story.
<Suoh_Akira> Alright. What about my idea? Consolidating redundant abilities?
<Genoce> Worth doing.
<killerb255> That will work.
<killerb255> ...start with the Level 8 abilities.  There's plenty of them there.
<Suoh_Akira> requesting permission to work on a power lineup for the Bard.
<Suoh_Akira> ::Rubs his hands together:: I'll try and have something by next week.
<Suoh_Akira> Rune Knight will definately be done.
<Lucas`> That being no limiters, but a big fat WARNING paragraph in the beginning of chapter 
three about abusing healing powers.
<killerb255> Didn't M say to account for the healing thingy each individual power instead of a 
universal solution?
<Genoce> Placing the onus on the GM is not the way to go.
<Genoce> That was my call for it.
<Genoce> You can't find a single rationale for everything.
<Lucas`> Nor will they really make that much sense. "Why can't my Chemist heal 100% HP? The 
White Mage can!"
<Captain_Vittles> Why can't a chemist heal 100% HP?  If they have an XPotion they should be 
able to.
<killerb255> ...then again, XPotion, W-Item, Double Effect can heal 1000 HP.
<Captain_Vittles> XPotions only heal 250 HP?
<killerb255> Yep.
<killerb255> Pathetic, isn't it?
<Captain_Vittles> What do Potions and HiPotions heal?
<killerb255> 50 and 100 respectively
<Lucas`> They need to be beefed up.
<Captain_Vittles> I say effect x 1.5
<Lucas`> keep Potion at 50, bump Hi Potion to 250 and X Potion to 500.
<Genoce> Prices stay the same?
<Lucas`> yeah.
<killerb255> ...and Auto-Potioning X-Potions means that the Chemist will never die.
<Genoce> Chemists don't have Auto-Potion.
<Genoce> I settled for Distribute.
<Suoh_Akira> Okay. I have an idea for one general healing power.
<Genoce> Go ahead, Adam.
<Suoh_Akira> Restores 1+(Level/11)d_xMDC HP.
<Suoh_Akira> So, default is 2d*.
<Suoh_Akira> Like Angel Psalm.
<Genoce> Level/11?
<Suoh_Akira> Err... River of Life.
<Genoce> That's a hell of a clunky equation.
<killerb255> You know what?
<Lucas`> Yeah it is.
<Suoh_Akira> I'm open to suggestions.
<killerb255> I'm having second thoughts about Chemists getting out-of-the-blue healing powers 
now.
<Lucas`> What song level is this for?
<killerb255> ...not because of the OOC reasons.
<killerb255> ...but because it's almost as strange for a Chemist to have divine healing powers 
without an item.
<Captain_Vittles> Level/11 is good because the upper limit is a solid 9
<killerb255> ...as it is for Auto Potion in a PnP game.
<Suoh_Akira> Well, level one. But it grows with the Bard, eliminating the need for redundant 
powers.
<Suoh_Akira> Maybe level 2?
<Captain_Vittles> Chemists should have Healer-powers with a material cost.
<Suoh_Akira> I'll run with level 2.
<killerb255> Distribute seems to be the best way to give the Chemist a handy healing power 
with a material cost.
<Genoce> Restore and Revive get thrown out.
*** Morbieus has joined #returners
<Genoce> Onto the Artist. 
<killerb255> Progression is horribly skewed, for one thing.
<killerb255> Level 85 for its final power?
<Lucas`> No power, not even magic, requires more than 64.
<Genoce> So the first step is to move them to Level 64 maximum. 
<killerb255> Oh yeah, the Bard...
<killerb255> ...I'd say fix that one while you're at it, Adam.
<killerb255> ...all the Magic users have been fixed.
<Suoh_Akira> OH!
<killerb255> ...as per the new progression.
<killerb255> Since the Bard uses 8 levels, much like a Magic Knight, I'd say use the new Magic 
Knight progression table.
<Captain_Vittles> Magic Knights use 8 levels?
<killerb255> Yep.
<Suoh_Akira> Blair. You're still going with the Elemental and Attack spells for Magic KNight, 
right?
<Captain_Vittles> yes
<Suoh_Akira> Okay. Back to Bard for a moment. With my adjustments for redundant powers, it has 
six available powers. Most levels have three or four.
<Suoh_Akira> My suggestion is to break off three of the powers into an additional level.
<killerb255> Leave it at the six you have.
<killerb255> ...unless they're totally redundant.
<killerb255> ...like two offensive spells, one doing totally different damage.
<killerb255> Level 8 obviously is an example: some songs are useless because others within the 
same level are better.
<killerb255> It be different if this were a Mage we were talking about: MP could easily be 
adjusted.
<killerb255> ...but all songs within a level for a Bard have the same Initiative Penalty.
<Suoh_Akira> Well, I am definately eliminating Tower of Sorrows.
<killerb255> Ok.
<Suoh_Akira> I may keep the light, dark, and non-elemental. Call of Dragon, I believe it is.
<killerb255> In fact, there are five 8th level songs, and four of them do offensive damage.
<killerb255> ...sorry, six, and five do offensive damage.
<Suoh_Akira> Level Eight Songs are as follows.
<Haeru> Mmm....
<Suoh_Akira> Call of the Dragon. Ascension of Darkness. Celestial Symphony. Hero's Song.
<Suoh_Akira> One non-elemental. One light. One dark. One stat booster.
<killerb255> Sounds good.
<killerb255> Oh, about the growing healing power you're talking about:
<killerb255> ...what level is that thing going to be?
<Suoh_Akira> I was thinking one or two.
<Suoh_Akira> I have it as level three. >.o
<killerb255> It's penalty may be redundant at high levels.
<killerb255> ...so 3 might be good.
<Genoce> Well, I guess we can all sign off now. 
<Genoce> Writeups to be discussed next week or when they get done.
<Evan> I'll have the light swords list done by tomorrow or Tuesday
<Evan> depends on how work goes.
<Lucas`> I'm probably going to work on the formal Knowledge skill write-up tomorrow.
<Genoce> OK. I've got the Chemist to tackle.
<Captain_Vittles> I've got magic.  :p  I'll work on Blue Magic learning penalties too.
<Captain_Vittles> I actually have some things done with magic.
<Captain_Vittles> I've cut the redundant/stupid spells and rearranged the others.
<Captain_Vittles> I wanna balance MP and damage before I release them.
<Suoh_Akira> I'll have a RK writeup by week's end.
