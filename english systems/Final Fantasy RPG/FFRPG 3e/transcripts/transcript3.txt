<eldersphinx> Partly what I've been pondering with the Geomancer is some powers that can
 differentiate the different Terrain abilities at high levels.
<Genoce> What do you mean?
<eldersphinx> Well, mechanics that would be unique to each Terrain - and hopefully, somewhat
 different from other class powers.
<Genoce> Still having a little trouble visualising...
<eldersphinx> So the Powerful Desert ability wouldn't just be a 8d6 'same-old-same-old' attack,
 but might instead be "Burning Sun - The Geomancer's ability intensifies the heat and radiance
 of the sun overhead to unheard-of levels. All Water and Ice attacks deal half damage."
<Genoce> Or slowing movement for monsters, or giving allies the ability to walk on water, that
 kind of thing.
<eldersphinx> Yep. I guess my main problem is going to be making the abilities *useful* - in a
 desert setting, the PCs may want to be using Water/Ice. The monsters likely won't.
<eldersphinx> The other thing I'm considering is a high-level Terrain Manipulation ability -
 the Geomancer summons a storm, or starts an earthquake, or something along those lines.
<eldersphinx> And then can invoke Terrain effects based on the summoned effect - lightning
 bolts, earthstrike, similar.
<Genoce> Against an appropriate Magic% roll?
<Genoce> Makes sense. 
<eldersphinx> Basically, it's a way for the Geomancer to 'bring in' a new set of Terrain
 abilities and use those effects, when she *really* doesn't want to use what's at hand.
<Genoce> Incidentally, I'm working on a short guide for Engineers to build Constructs using the
 MCS.
<eldersphinx> "Crap, these Forest Terrain effects all suck rocks against the Lord of Trees
 we're fighting. Alright then - Terrain Manipulation: Storm! Eat lightning!"
<eldersphinx> Constructs with the MCS. Could be interesting.
<eldersphinx> Incidentally, do you think we might be able to get to the point where we had more
 than one type of Engineer character again?
<Genoce> For those folks who want to have a little robot pal tagging along or something. 
<Genoce> Hm. Hard to say. We're scrabbling enough to find Abilities for the one Engineer we
 already have...
<Genoce> Where'd the divisions be?
<eldersphinx> What I'm thinking is that there's fairly solid precendent for an Engineer-type
 that *only* builds Constructs - Dr. Lugae, from FF4.
<eldersphinx> As a matter of fact, a Construct-building Engineer *could* conceivavly use rules
 similar to a Monster Trainer character, just with different names on all the powers.
<Genoce> I'm seeing more future in overhauling them as Mediators.
<eldersphinx> Probably.
<eldersphinx> I do like the idea of giving them Oracle-style status effects, though, too.
<Genoce> Does 25,000 gil for a Level 50 Construct, Large-Sized, sound a little too cheap for
 you?
<eldersphinx> This would be about an effective a combatant as an extra character of about 40th
 level, right?
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> Unless I make the extra systems cost more.
<Genoce> 50,000?
<Genoce> That'd be ([Level x 500] x Size Modifier).
<Genoce> ...which would technically allow a starting Engineer to begin the game with a Level 1
 Construct.
<Genoce> In place of a normal Invention.
<eldersphinx> Hmm. Given that the Construct *is* the Engineer's class power, and doesn't come
 with Cleave or Level 8 Black Magic of its own, souonds about right.
<eldersphinx> Has anyone ever figured out a "Gil curve" yet - how much gold a character of a
 given level is expected to have?
<Genoce> Not really. It's not exactly a constant, short of looking at experience level/GP
 distribution with monsters.
<Genoce> A Level 1 Monster is worth 400 XP and 150 gil.
<Genoce> Assuming the average party of four, that'd come out to 100 XP and 37 gil per
 character.
<Genoce> Per Level.
<Genoce> At Level 50, that would mean about 1875 gil per monster per character.
<eldersphinx> Yep. What I mean is along the lines of "A Level 40 character has fought enough
 monsters to earn..." (calculating)
<eldersphinx> about 400,000 XP. How many Gil has he earned in that time?
<eldersphinx> I guess on a linear, it would be about 150,000...
*** Adam_Is_Afk has joined #returners
*** Adam_Is_Afk is now known as Imagined_Reality
<Genoce> Yep.
<eldersphinx> Hey, Adam.
<Imagined_Reality> Hello.
<Genoce> That's not including awards for selling equipment, completing quests, etc.
<eldersphinx> Okay, I guess the only trick is to figure out what 150k gil can buy you.
<Genoce> Cumulatively.
<Genoce> Adam, what headway on the RK and Bard?
<Imagined_Reality> Well.... I'm having trouble describing Soul Ruin. Please.
<Imagined_Reality> Bard stuff is pretty much done.
<Imagined_Reality> The idea I outlined to you will be default.
<Imagined_Reality> But as an alternate rule will be the one of each stat boost per person per
 battle thing.
<Imagined_Reality> What modifiers are we looking at for those every round skill checks?
<Genoce> -10, 15% per Round.
<Imagined_Reality> So it gets bigger, or remains at 10-15% per round>
<Genoce> Cumulative.
<Imagined_Reality> I dunno about that, M... If we're going to do that, maybe it should be five
 per round..
<Genoce> Depends on how long a Bard should be able to twist out a song.
<Genoce> Rodger - I don't think Constructs should get Spell Abilities. Do you agree or
 disagree?
<Imagined_Reality> Well, a typical song is about our minutes long.
<eldersphinx> Don't know if dropping it down to 5% per round is necessary. I mean, a five-round
 fight, that's only a 20% penalty at the end of the battle.
<Imagined_Reality> But a Bard's song typically tells a long story.
<Imagined_Reality> That's assuming a long fight.
<Imagined_Reality> Stuff happens.
<eldersphinx> How about 5% for first and second level spells, 10% for third and fourth, etc?
<Imagined_Reality> Hmmmm...
<eldersphinx> Allows low-level Bards a chance to allow their basic effects time to last, high
-level bards have to *worry* about their high-level effects lasting.
<eldersphinx> Means that a Bard might not want to throw a Level 8 stat boost at the beginning
 of a big fight - he might start with a more-certain Level 4 effect instead.
<eldersphinx> M: I can definitely see Constructs not having Spell Abilities. They're not
 special-ops tools.
<Genoce> OK, cool.
<Genoce> Job Abilities should stay, though.
<Genoce> If for no other reason than the fact that Cait Sith in FFX had Steal.
<eldersphinx> ... Although I can see some players wanting their Robo-sidekick to be able to
 Peep an enemy, or help out with an Antidote spell.,. I wonder if we might be able to just give
 Constructs a really crappy Magic% score, and allow them to use Spell Abilities?
<Genoce> Mechanical things aren't supposed to have magic, though.
<eldersphinx> M: I assume that your average Construct wouldn't be using Job Abilities on a
 scale equal to it's monster level?
<eldersphinx> I just don't want an excuse for an Engineer to have an Ultima-wielding pet.
<eldersphinx> Y'know, looking back at the Geomancer... I'm not sure that the powers are as one
-dimensional as people think.
<eldersphinx> Of the ten terrains, only four of them are lacking at least two 'special effect'
 attacks.
<Imagined_Reality> How are the abilities one sided?
<eldersphinx> Almost all direct attacks.
<eldersphinx> Out of forty different effects, only one is a healing ability.
<Imagined_Reality> In FFT, most of the attacks pegged on a status too.
<eldersphinx> Adam: And that's the case here, too. Though being able to throw Stop with the
 Level 1 Plains ability is somewhat broken.
<eldersphinx> When Stop is a Level 8 mage spell, and a Geomancer can unleash it at Level 1?
<Imagined_Reality> I say have Hell Ivy have a effect like Hold and move Stop elsewhere.
<eldersphinx> The Hold spell effect. :)
<Imagined_Reality> So all that's really needed is so shuffle the status effects around. Maybe
 throw in a healing power or two too?
<eldersphinx> We may want to bring this up during the formal meeting, and let members
 brainstorm on it.
<Genoce> Did you see Jacob's revision of it at all?
<eldersphinx> The Geomancer may just need a bit more imagination in its power write-ups. I
 mean, forming an evocative description of the power from what's currently in the write-up is
 *not* an easy task.
<Genoce> Uh-huh.
*** Hiro has joined #returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Hiro
<eldersphinx> Hey Rob.
<Hiro> hey
<Imagined_Reality> Yo, Rob.
* Hiro yawns
<Genoce> Early enough for you?
<Hiro> Considering I just dragged myself out of bed a minute or so ago, yes.
<Genoce> Another late night, I presume.
*** Demonic_Gerbil has joined #Returners
<Genoce> Hi, Elisha.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Howdy.
<Hiro> I might as well bring this up now. I have a possible fix in mind for the Map combat
 issue- that is, to create an appendix for map combat/mass combat. I'm tentatively calling it
 'Final Fantasy RPG Tactics'.
<Hiro> My idea in addition to map combat in general would cover unit based battles (where each
 character controls a unit of soldiers) and large scale army battles (where the characters may
 be fighting thousands against thousands). Most of these two parts of system are still pretty
 fuzzy, but I expect to have more as I get around to writing the appendix up in greater detail. 
<Genoce> This would replace the Mass Combat rules for the PCom, right?
<Hiro> Yeah. Or, it would include them to some extent.
<Genoce> So where would that leave the range dilemma?
*** Jeff has joined #Returners
<Genoce> Hey, Jeff.
<Jeff> Hey, M.
<eldersphinx> Hey.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Hi.
*** dave has joined #Returners
<Genoce> Hi.
* dave nods
<Genoce> Actually, why don't I give a quick rundown of what I had in mind?
<Genoce> 1. Range Issues. I really want to see the map combat question brought to a close at
 this meetings. Three weeks is long enough.
*** LordMagius has joined #returners
<Hiro> Ranges have been a big sticking point as of late. I'd like to see the matter finished
 once & for all.
<Jeff> As far as I know, there's been one use of map combat ever in FFRPG PBeM history.
<Genoce> And most of the GMs I've talked to agree they could get more use out of meters.
<Genoce> Most? All.
<Jeff> I don't like meters.
<Genoce> What, then. Feet?
<Jeff> Granted, it makes more sense.
<Hiro> Meter/Yards. I'd like to keep it somewhat unit-independant.
<Imagined_Reality> I say meters.
<Hiro> As far as the map combat system goes, M & I loosely have plans to move it into its own
 appendix in the CR along with some material for unit-based battles and large scale stuff.
<LordMagius> large scale combat, are you going to be updating the stuff in the ord then?
<Genoce> I had some ideas.
<Genoce> Which still leaves the question as to what this does for our range debate.
<LordMagius> simple, one hex/square = 10 meters/yards/feet/inches/etc...
<Jeff> That makes hexes freaking huge.
<eldersphinx> And player characters grow or shrink depending on what you define a 'hex' as?
<Hiro> 10 meters = 30 yards = 90 feet.
<Hiro> very roughly.
<LordMagius> 10 meters = 10 yards = 30 feet
<Jeff> You could have a whole small engagement in a single hex at 30 yards.
<Hiro> doh
<Genoce> This does not solve the ranged weapons issue.
<Genoce> Nor does it cover the 'living room Ultima effect'.
<Hiro> It could also be rather confusing.
<Jeff> What exactly is this ranged weapons issue?
<Genoce> Rifles shooting 12 meters.
<Hiro> I feel the different conversion rates would settle the issue.
<eldersphinx> The problem I see with twinking scales is making spell AoEs work. Why does a
 Fire2 hit a 3-meter wide area in single combat, but a 30-meter area in a mass engagement?
<Genoce> That's what I call the 'living room Ultima issue'
<Jeff> Point taken.
<Imagined_Reality> I have it!
<Imagined_Reality> Because the unit pools all of their powers together.
<Imagined_Reality> Say you have a unit of Black Mages.
<Imagined_Reality> They pool their magic together, and execute a larger effect of Fire2.
<Jeff> Mass engagements, though, won't necessarily always be in units.
<Hiro> That could be a bit tricky. Besides- just how many FF games have a whole unit of black
 mages on hand?
<Genoce> Which also begs the question: if Black Mages can chain together in mass combat, why
 not in the smaller-scale FFRPG?
<Genoce> Though there are precedents for that.
<Jeff> Double/Triple Techs.
<eldersphinx> And Twin.
<Hiro> Which aren't core stuff.
<Jeff> Make them so. :P
<Genoce> Should we have a core Limit system?
<Jeff> Tempting.
<Hiro> Very.
<Jeff> But it'd piss off those people who want a more old-school FF game.
<Imagined_Reality> Like me.
<Jeff> I like them because, again, customization.
<Genoce> It doesn't need to be compulsory.
* Jeff nods to M.
<Jeff> I say we move both Combos and Limits into Core, but tag them with a very prominent
 "Optional" tag.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Why not write up a couple different versions (so each different Limit Break
 style is covered) and then stick them in as optional
<Jeff> FFX handles it nicely because everyone raises their Limit meters a different way.
<Genoce> Exactly.
<Genoce> The way I saw it, we can break it into three trigger types for Breaks.
<Genoce> What are we going to do in regards to hex ranges?
<Imagined_Reality> We need scale.
<Jeff> I like a small scale, but that's just me. Too big, and combat loses realism as people
 literally are fighting in one hex.
<Genoce> I mean on a more fundamental level.
<Imagined_Reality> We need to make it adaptable for ALL distances.
<Hiro> Why can't we simply go with different conversion rates for REV stats? ie, the rifle
 example. R:8. Can shoot 8 hexes away or 16 meters. 
<Genoce> Because it's easier to just say: 
<Genoce> Rifle. Maximum Range: 450 meters.
<Genoce> Conversion Chart for Map Combat:
<Genoce> 200-450 meters = 8 hexes.
<Genoce> There.
<Genoce> Values preserved.
<Hiro> You can shoot farther than the basic range with a penalty for accuracy.
<Jeff> So a hex is 50 meters?
<Genoce> No.
<Genoce> A hex is a hex. 
<Imagined_Reality> Then we get back to the uniform distance problem.
<Hiro> I highly down anybody with a Rifle can really shoot accurately something 400 meters
 away.
<Hiro> -down +doubt.
<Jeff> Depends on the rifle.
<LordMagius> sorry rob, but I can.
<Genoce> Can I finish?
<eldersphinx> Depends more on the target. Sitting duck? Sure. Intelligent goblin? Yeah, right.
<eldersphinx> Go ahead, M.
<Genoce> As I've said before, the problem is that we're trying to find a uniform scale where
 there really isn't one.
<Genoce> The hex values we have are based on FFT for the most part.
* Jeff nods to M.
<Genoce> And that's hardly an accurate reproduction of anything.
<Genoce> Hex combat isn't supposed to really be an 'accurate' representation of the battlefield
 by that dint.
<Jeff> I think I see what M's saying.
<Genoce> We sacrifice accuracy for playability.
<Jeff> It makes sense.
<Jeff> Hex ranges and meter ranges are independent.
<Jeff> Because there's no way we can properly convert the two without scale.
<Genoce> Yep. OK. Do we want to take the mass combat appendix and run with it?
<eldersphinx> Mass combat in general, probably. If we're removing Jared's old kitbash.
<Genoce> I worked out a basic 'unit generation system'.
<Genoce> Anyway, the way I saw it, it'd involve three types of units.
<Genoce> Heroes, Units and Engines.
<Jeff> Engines?
<Genoce> Siege Engines. 
<eldersphinx> Reasonable. Though 'Engines' would probably include large monsters as well.
<LordMagius> War Machines
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> Anything that's larger than a single hero.
<Hiro> Engines sounds pretty vague.
<Jeff> Units are composed of multiple creatures/heroes?
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> Basically, the grunts.
<Hiro> Makes sense.
<Jeff> So could you theoretically mix the two?
<Hiro> Units and War Machines can be built through the MCS or something similar.
<Jeff> Ie, Brigandine has one Rune Knight, then a units worth of monsters under him.
<Hiro> Langrisser is similar.
<Genoce> OK, but units are essentially considered one large target with large HP.
<Jeff> Like Langrisser.
<Jeff> Alright, I see where M is going.
<Genoce> The number of people in the unit determines how many times the unit attacks, how much
 health it has to spare, and so forth.
<Jeff> Heroes = Commanders in Langrisser, Units = Units.
<Hiro> Okay, so how do we handle damage in the Unit Scale?
<Genoce> DC dependent on unit size.
<Jeff> (Ie, a 4-5 HP unit is not as effective as one at full strength.
<Genoce> So, Rob wants to handle mass combat?
<Jeff> I'll work with Rob on it.
<Genoce> OK. When can we expect to see something?
<eldersphinx> Will we be able to get much further on a mass combat discussion? Or is it time to
 send this topic to Development and move on?
<Hiro> I'd probably say send it to the development. Jeff & I will work on something sometime
 this week since I'm going to be off.
<eldersphinx> Sounds good. On to class discussion, then?
<Imagined_Reality> Let us begin with the Bard.
<Adam_Sama> Okay.
<Adam_Sama> For stat boosting spells...
<Adam_Sama> Basically, the stat boost only last as long as the song is played.
<Adam_Sama> The Bard must pass a skill check everyone round to continue playing.
<Adam_Sama> S/he may end the song at any time, but must wait until the next round to begin a
 new one.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Uh Adam, so a lone bard wouldn't be able to take advantage of stat boosting
 songs himself?  IIRC, one of the complaints about the Mimic is how he's dead by himself.  Not
 letting the bard pump himself up is paramount to the same thing.
<Adam_Sama> A Bard is a support person.
<Jeff> He should be able to help himself though.
<Adam_Sama> There IS, however, another option.
<Adam_Sama> A stat boost spell last the battle.
<Adam_Sama> But any job may only be affected by any song once.
<Adam_Sama> Any stat boosting song, that is.
<eldersphinx> IIRC, a Bard isn't too shabby in the direct-attack department. That'd allow him
 some solo capability even without self-boost spells.
<Adam_Sama> If we go with the every round skill checks, however, I won't eliminate the stronger
 versions of stat boosts.
<Adam_Sama> If I run with the second idea, I will.
<Hiro> I'm tempted to to bring up splitting the stat boosters and stat decreasers between the
 Dancer and the Bard.
<Demonic_Gerbil> It bothers me Rob, just cause the Bard doesn't have much else to mess with the
 enemy in his arsenal.  ^_^  But it makes sense too... the Bard in FF affects his party, the
 Dancer affects the enemy party.
<eldersphinx> Sounds fair. The Dancer's always seemed more attack-oriented, and the Bard
 defense-oriented, IMHO.
<Adam_Sama> We should, however, keep the attacks on the Bard. Give it SOME attack value.
* Jeff nods.
<eldersphinx> Sure. Direct attacks for the Bard is fine.
<Jeff> I'm gonna agree with Rodger here.
<Jeff> The Bard should work in opposite to the dancer, otherwise, they're the same.
<Jeff> Give it some attack capability, but that's ti.
<Jeff> Er, it.
<Jeff> We're talking about the Bard.
<Genoce> So, what's on the Bard front?
<Demonic_Gerbil> So far, stat down attacks look they're going to the dancer and... (waits for
 someone else to fill the rest)
<Hiro> I'm in favor of moving the stat down songs to the Dancer as a way to un-tank the Bard as
 well as give the Dancer something of use.
<Jeff> The Bard is a tank?
<Jeff> Could have fooled me.
<Genoce> Brandon had a good analysis of the whole profession.
<Jeff> And the Dancer had stat downs in FFT to begin with.
<eldersphinx> The main thing that allows the Bard to tank is its healing abilities.
<Adam_Sama> But as long as the attack songs remain, I think we have a happy medium.
<Hiro> It's a tank in that it can do almost everything- status conditions, heal, attack,
 inflict conditions, etc.
<Genoce> And who is going to handle the Dancer?
<Adam_Sama> It means the Bard keeps the stronger versions of his stat boosters.
<Adam_Sama> I have to go afk when we table the Bard for a bit.
<Demonic_Gerbil> All the dancer needs is the stat down attacks moved over, right?  If that's
 it, I guess I could do the write up and float it to the list.
*** LordMagius has joined #returners
<LordMagius> I'm back
<Genoce> Hi, Steven.
*** Haeru has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hi.
<Haeru> Greetings!
<Genoce> OK. So, Bard has been partitioned off. Dancer has been partitioned off.
<Genoce> Other problem professions...
<Genoce> Artist.
<Genoce> Well, the current writeup is extremely screwy.
<Genoce> Especially with penalties, abilities, out of combat usage, and the Level 83 max.
<Genoce> The first thing we'd need to do is tone it down to Level 64 as the Ability cap.
<eldersphinx> Sure.
<Haeru> For some odd reason, the L64 cap fits the e-games just as much as it fits the demand
 for lack of powergaming...
<Haeru> You can get just about everything in an FF game and then beat it by Level 64.
<Hiro> I'm sure we can manage to fit inot the usual 10 string setup or something similar.
<Hiro> Or we could ask Richard, who wrote the Artist abilities to figure something out.
<Genoce> All right. Mimic?
<Genoce> Question from the floor here...
<Genoce> Jon Lantzy again. 
<Genoce> A simple question that's been bothering me about the mimic.  What is wrong with the
 2.0 rules for the mimic?  I can understand the reasoning behind trying to merge the mimic and
 the beastmaster, but I've never been able to get an answer as to why the 2.0 mimic is
 considered.... broken or unbalanced.
<eldersphinx> Well, in a group the Mimic is scary. Solo the Mimic is a joke.
<Demonic_Gerbil> It is?  It can whip out all sorts of fun stuff on the enemy as long as it has
 a friend nearby. :)
<Jeff> The Mime worries me.
*** Teirlap has joined #returners
<Hiro> Not when you consider the Mimic miming Ultima or Cleave...
<Adam_Sama_Is_Afk> It's based too much off of the FFT Mime.
<Jeff> I say we keep the memorization ability.
<Haeru> On the contrary.
<Hiro> There's a difference: the FFT Mime had no equipment.
<Genoce> Hey, Teirlap.
<eldersphinx> IIRC, the Mimic is most closely based off of the FF5 Mimic.
<Teirlap> 'Afternoon (or 'Evening).
<eldersphinx> Hey Teirlap.
<LordMagius> mornin
<eldersphinx> Back onto the Mimic. Do we need to do something to give it some solo punch, do
 something to tone down its power in a large party, or both? Or neither?
<eldersphinx> IMHO - "The Mimic is lunchmeat on his own, and bloody *nasty* when with more than
 three other PCs."
<Haeru> The Mimic never was intended to be a solo character.
<Jeff> He's not that much lunch meat if he memorizes another's abilities.
<eldersphinx> Well, that's a question to address. Can the Mimic successfully memorize another
 PC's abilities and then hold onto them for a long period?
<Jeff> Didn't it always have that ability?
<Haeru> Seems a little on the inviting cheese in...
<Hiro> Maybe we should simply expand the rules for memorizing abilities. I'm tempted to say it
 should be based on the abilities used. For instance, if he mimes the Fire 1 spell, he can use
 Fire 1 later. But he can't use Fire 2, because he doesn't know it.
<eldersphinx> Memorization, yes. How long it *kept* the abilities relied on the GM's kindness.
<Jeff> Not if limiting factors are applied.
<Haeru> Until the end of combat? Heh.
<Jeff> 1) To memorize someone's abilities, you'd need to spend a fair deal of time with them.
<Jeff> 2) Duration. Can't keep em forever.
<Hiro> hmm. Maybe limit it somehow based on their level.
<eldersphinx> Limiting factors on the Mimic.
<eldersphinx> I gotta say, the Mimic power is probably more twinkable than the Memorization
 power.
<Jeff> Indeed.
<Jeff> Because all a Mimic has to do in combat is....well, Mimic.
<eldersphinx> Anybody have any objection to *not* giving the Mimic the Mime power at first
 level?
<Jeff> What good is a Mimic that can't Mimic, Rodger?
<Haeru> That seems... iffy.
<Hiro> For one, any ability that has an initiative penalty must go after the original attacker.
<eldersphinx> Just let them Memorize a fellow PC's abilities as a starting character?
<Hiro> I think that's already obvious.
<Jeff> That might make sense.
<Jeff> It's more difficult to learn to use a power on the fly, than to study someone and work
 at it.
<Hiro> How about this as a limiter for memorization: allow the mime at low levels to only
 memorize abilities used in battle that they mime. Then at a later level give them an ability
 to use the abilities used by others that they see.
<Hiro> Sorta like Visualization from the Blue Mage.
<Adam_Sama> How long does the memorization last?
<Jeff> Level or Level/2 in days?
<Hiro> (XP LVL - XP LVL need for ability)/2 hours?
<Demonic_Gerbil> THe Mimic should only be able to have a certain number of power memorized at
 any time, like Magic/3 or something.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Or he could memorize a whole arsenal and kill everything himself.
<Hiro> That's another thing that should be added.
<Hiro> The limit on powers the mimic can memorize.
<Jeff> And is he memorizing single powers, or a power set?
<Jeff> Ie, does he memorize dispatch, or all Sword Techs up to the level of the Swordmaster?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Single powers.
<Genoce> So, who's going to handle the writeup this time around?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Maybe he has to be at a high enough level to use them if he was in that job. 
 SO a low-level mimic doesn't get Quadra-Slice from a high-level NPC Swordmaster.
<Jeff> Mimic can memorize one power for every 8 levels of experience.
<Jeff> Therefore, at 64th level, the mimic can have 8 class powers, plus Memorize, plus mimic.
<Jeff> 10 powers.
<Jeff> Just like everyone else.
<Jeff> Someone want to condense everything we just said about the Mimic real quick, so one of
 us (I'll do it, since I proposed it, if no one else wants), for legibility?
<eldersphinx> One other thought for the Mimic - create some treasure-items that allow him to
 'memorize' abilities that nobody else in the party might have.
<eldersphinx> Well, say, a 'Paladin' Gem that would allow a Mimic to use Memorize to get Stasis
 Sword in one of his Memorize slots, even if no Paladins were in the party.
<Hiro> (XP LVL - XP LVL required for the power)/2 hours.
<Jeff> DL/Gabe Gilreath had a character like that he wrote, at least similarly speaking. His
 usable abilities were based off various relics he had equipped.
<Haeru> I thought of one thing that might be useful as a limiter on the Mimic's powers if 
necessary.
<eldersphinx> The Gems also provide something of a fix for the people who are masochistic 
enough to use a Mimic in a solo game - they can pick up Gems as class items, and be able to do 
*something*.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Hmmm...  Do memorized powers require MP to use if the Mimic memorizes a spell?
<Jeff> The Mimic needs MP dice then.
<Hiro> d6 should be enough. Or d8.
<Demonic_Gerbil> I say Memorized powers do, but we leave the Mimic command free of things like 
that.
<Hiro> Mimic and memorize are two different powers.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Anything Mimed is free of any costs.  The Mimic only needs to have enough MP 
to cast the spell, he doesn't get charged for it when Miming.
<Genoce> So, who's going to spin all this into a writeup?
<Jeff> Apparently me.
<eldersphinx> Next topic is the Geomancer.
<Genoce> Rodger, do you want to talk this one through?
<eldersphinx> With the Geomancer, it
<eldersphinx> 's basically a matter of focus.
<eldersphinx> Sorry about the rogue carriage-returns, BTW.
<eldersphinx> The Geomancer can't really do anything but attack.
<Adam_Sama> It needs some defensive value.
<Demonic_Gerbil> That's all the FFT Geomancer could basically do...
<Haeru> They had secondary abilities to back them up in FFT.
<Jeff> But since you don't know the effect you get until you target the intended AoE, it's hard 
to try and heal your friends when you could inadvertently impale them with tree branches.
<Jeff> Hmm, maybe toss in one non attack orientated power per terrain type?
<eldersphinx> That's about what I was thinking.
<Haeru> Seems appropriate.
<eldersphinx> It's actually quite a bit better now that it has the Dancer powers as backup.
<Genoce> I thought water walking.
<Genoce> Things like that.
<Genoce> Kind of consolidate the whole 'ignore terrain' schtick.
<Jeff> Could do a Camouflage type thing with vanish.
<Hiro> Or being able to breathe underwater.
<eldersphinx> I'm thinking that two or three terrains would get a healing ability, three more 
might get movement - flight, water-walking, or even teleport - and the others would get 
Defensive abilities.
<Hiro> Maybe a power to survive harsh environments like tundras or deserts?
<eldersphinx> One other potential problem I see with the Geomancer is the point at where their 
abilities top out. 8d6, max.
<Haeru> Have Geomancy will travel.
<Jeff> 8d6 is stronger than an Elemental.
<Hiro> Hmm. That's something that's bugged me in the past as well. But I'm unsure how to really 
fix it. 
<Jeff> You could have one 'ultimate' type ability per terrain, too, if you wanted.
<Hiro> The level 4 attacks were designed to be the be all super power.
<eldersphinx> I've actually had one thought for a 'high-level' Geomancer power where the 
Geomancer summons a natural phenomenon.
<Hiro> Yeah. You can make a Tsunami, earthquakes, typhoons, and all kinds of stuff for level 4 
powers.
<Jeff> Ie, Awaken Landscape, or whatever.
<Haeru> I don't think the Geomancer would really -want- to cause massive landscape destruction 
unless it was really necessary, much less considering the power of such an event would far 
exceed any other class...
<eldersphinx> I'll tackle a write-up on that, but basically it'd allow for a higher level of 
Geomancy effects, based around the disaster invoked.
<Genoce> OK. So, Rodger -- do you want to go ahead and spin out a full set of rules and post it 
to the list?
*** PoeticJustice has joined #returners
<eldersphinx> Sure thing.
<Genoce> Hi, Jacob.
<eldersphinx> For disasters, BTW, I'm basically looking at four - a Storm effect (Wind and 
Lightning), an Earthquake (Earth), and two others.
<PoeticJustice> Hi, Everybody! (Hi, Dr. Nick!)
<eldersphinx> Heatwave (fire effects and anti-Water/Ice) may make my list. So may Blizzard.
<PoeticJustice> Where are we?
<eldersphinx> Geomancer.
<Genoce> Don't they already have a 'Local Quake' attack?
<PoeticJustice> Something similar to the Quake spell?
<Adam_Sama> Something bigger, perhaps?
<Genoce> Call it 'Magnitude 10'.
<Adam_Sama> Can we visit the idea my friend came up with for the Black Belt?
<Adam_Sama> My friend suggested the possibility of a Black Belt being able to hit twice like 
Yang and the FFI Black Belt.
<Genoce> Technically speaking, that's what DC does.
<Genoce> As I see it.
<Jeff> DC is basically the FF1 "# of hits".
<Genoce> Hitting twice with a Glove or a Claw is the same thing as dual-wielding a sword.
<Genoce> You need Two Weapons, plus two Claws/Gloves.
<Genoce> I wrote this into the Skill description but forgot to mention it earlier.
<Jeff> But one Job already has auto Two Weapons.
<PoeticJustice> Hurm....makes logical sense....but I figgured Claws and Gloves were more 
intuitive -- you punch with 'em, just like a fist...
<Hiro> Question though: why does the Black Belt need a seperate skill to punch with both hands?
<Genoce> Because it takes the cheapness factor out of it.
<Genoce> That's why.
<PoeticJustice> Good point....it does make it much more rules-sense...
<PoeticJustice> There's just a lot of prescedence for Monks punching a bunch of times to deal 
their damage, which wasn't that much more than normal...
<PoeticJustice> Though Pummel does that, so nevermind...:)
<Adam_Sama> Next is...
<Genoce> Engineer.
<Hiro> Which support powers do we have so far?
<Genoce> Well, there's Maintenance.
<Hiro> And Scan.
<Genoce> Then there's a weaker version of Maintenance for the Engineer's allies.
<Jeff> Engineer's getting support powers?
<Genoce> No.
<Genoce> Not Scan.
<Genoce> Scan = history.
<Hiro> Why?
<Genoce> Because it's an invention-based advantage.
<Hiro> Scan/Peep/whatever.
<Genoce> Was an Invention in FF4.
<eldersphinx> Scan can be provided with an invention. Easy.
<Hiro> It makes a decent ability for them.
<Genoce> It doesn't make any sense, though.
<Genoce> Construct Killer, anyone?
<Adam_Sama> Engineers start with a single level one invention of their choice?
<PoeticJustice> Yeah....I'm with M....makes more sense for someone like a Blue Mage to know 
what the monsters pack...
<Genoce> Adam - Yes.
<Jeff> Construct Killer?
<Genoce> That's their 'Level 1' Ability, so to speak.
<Adam_Sama> Then they can choose whatever invention does Scan if they want to.
<Adam_Sama> Let's leave it at that.
<Hiro> That might be cheap, but it'd make sense.
<PoeticJustice> They sorta know how to hit mechaincal critters to destroy them, since they know 
what makes 'em tick...likin' it.
<Genoce> I also talked to Rodger about giving Engineers the ability to build little robot 
buddies.
<Genoce> Yet another FFX item.
<PoeticJustice> Hehe...also like it. Little mechanical familiars. :)
<Hiro> That could be kinda dangerous in the right hands.
<Adam_Sama> Obsessing over FFX already, M? ¬_¬
<Genoce> You'd better believe it.
<Genoce> Rob - It's using a modification of the MCS.
<PoeticJustice> No more dangerous than an animal or similar, I'd think, Rob....
<Genoce> Animal Companion.
<Genoce> Only you have to pay for it.
*** Deathcrow has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hey, Crow.
<Deathcrow> Hello
<Genoce> If you've got a choice between a 500-gil invention and a 500-gil 
construct/robot/familiar, you start getting a little more differentiation between Engineer 
types.
<PoeticJustice> Yeah.....you could eventually have one decked out in gadgets, and one riding 
around in M-Tek-Armor-Lookin'-Stuff
<PoeticJustice> Quite cool, I think. :)
<PoeticJustice> I've been wanting to play a character with little robot buddies. :)
<Genoce> Incidentally, speaking of that, Joe made the suggestion that Engineers should be 
allowed to upgrade their inventions, too.
<Genoce> To save time in PBEMs.
<Genoce> I think it's a good idea, personally.
<Genoce> Since they get a starting invention anyway, it'll make it more feasible for Engineers 
to keep up with the rest of the pack.
<Adam_Sama> Save time AND money.
<Hiro> That's something I've considered in the past, although I think at that point, I went 
about it in the wrong way.
<PoeticJustice> Sure...."levels" of inventions.....upgrade it to something more potent.
<Genoce> How so, Rob?
<Hiro> ie, like Wild Arms where you could upgrade damage, ammo, etc.
<Hiro> Hmm.
<Genoce> Wouldn't it just mean swapping one System with another?
<Genoce> Or adding on Systems?
<Hiro> Adding systems, more likely. But then- that's what upgrading (essentially) would do.
<Genoce> Then the cost would be calculated by only the Systems being added.
<Genoce> As well as the time requirements.
<PoeticJustice> So something that can scan/peep might eventually also gain the ability to grant 
a bonus to hit or something....
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> You could keep adding bells and whistles onto a starter invention.
<Genoce> Which is pretty much in character.
<Genoce> You can picture Engineers having their one 'ultimate invention' they keep working at 
and refining.
<PoeticJustice> Or you could keep the scan/peep, and build something else that does something 
totally differen?
<Genoce> Well, you can only get so much mileage out of the average pea-shooter.
<Genoce> And you can't just turn it into an Armor Generator overnight.
<Genoce> In some cases the Engineer would have to start from scratch.
<Adam_Sama> Right...
<Hiro> We could limit inventions to a maxium of three Systems. Or make inventions based on 
size.
<Genoce> Or just make Systems mutually exclusive.
<Hiro> one system is pretty small. but two is bigger. and three is like a friggin' bazooka.
<eldersphinx> Actually, a useful limitation might be to subdivide systems into different 
categories. Say, Attack, Defend, Move, and Perceive.
<eldersphinx> And any given Invention can only have powers from one category,
<Adam_Sama> Nice idea, Rodger.
<PoeticJustice> Better divide it into at least 3...
<Adam_Sama> Why should an Engineer not be able to make a scope for his rifle?
<Adam_Sama> Let's see the engineer makes a sort of low powered beam rifle.
<Adam_Sama> Why shouldn't he be able to make it more accurate through a scope.
<Genoce> Wouldn't he be using the Sniper Scope weapon accessory?
<eldersphinx> An invention ability that grants a bonus to attack, for instance, would go into 
both the Attack and the Perceive categories.
<Hiro> Doesn't necessarily have to be a Sniper Scope. It could just be a system that grants a 
bonus to hit.
<Genoce> Hm. So, should the ability for Inventions to 'link up' be covered as a separate 
system?
<Genoce> Like 'Modularity' or something to that effect?
<Hiro> That might make inventions cost too much.
<Genoce> Unless it's added outside of Systems as a special feature.
<Hiro> Actually the modularity system might work: Simply do the scope or whatever as a 2nd 
invention.
<Genoce> Any particular cost/time disadvantages?
<Hiro> I wouldn't say so. Simply make a 1 level System. So if the Scope has a +20% bonus (LVL2) 
it'd be a LVL 3 invention with the modularity.
<Genoce> OK.
<Genoce> We'll have to see how that works out.
<Hiro> What about other Engineer abilities?
<Genoce> Bearing in mind that the Inventions are, essentially, the Engineer's progression, I 
think the four we have might just do it.
<Hiro> Construct Killer, Robot, Maintenance, and what else?
<Genoce> The Level 1 invention I considered an Ability, of sorts.
<Hiro> On a slightly engineer related note, teh Repair skill should have some kind of note on 
how to repair Damaged or Broken equipment.
<Genoce> Definitely.
<Genoce> By the way, any particular objections towards allowing Invent to cover Explosives and 
Ammo?
<Deathcrow> It would be the field of chemists
<Genoce> Hm. Good point.
<Genoce> Especially as FFX handles it as such.
<Genoce> OK. So we'll give Alchemy the equivalent of 'Refine'.
<Deathcrow> Ammo design could be done by engineer, but the chemical components would 
bwefinitely be chemist
<Deathcrow> The two of them working together could create killer ammo
* Hiro nods
<Genoce> It'd be a nice teamwork incentive if we could pull it off.
<Haeru> An Engineer has to have fuel for his creations...
<eldersphinx> Chemist-Engineer teamwork = Double Techs?
<Deathcrow> Probably
<Genoce> The new Battery items in Chapter 5 are what I'd pegged as the main power source of 
Inventions.
<Genoce> I like it.
<Hiro> Maybe list explosives or ammo with a difficulty penalty based on how powerful it is.
<Genoce> Like Recovery and One-Shot items.
<Deathcrow> The engineer could work on the shell as some kind of invention and the chemist 
could use alchemy to create the powder
<Genoce> Hm. Maybe a full-bore section on 'collaborative productions' is worth adding.
<Genoce> Especially when considering Metalworking.
<Genoce> Should I tackle the writeup?
<Genoce> Or does anybody else fancy giving it a shot?
<Deathcrow> I could try to give it a shot, but you'd have to tell me what you want in details
<Genoce> OK. 
<Hiro> Speaking of skills, I have some thoughts on other ways to improve the use of skills. One 
idea is maybe incorporating different kind of skill rolls if it hasn't already been done. I was 
thinking along the lines of 'Unopposed Skill Actions', 'Opposed Skill Actions', 'Contested 
Skill Actions', etc.
* Hiro ponders
<Hiro> I was thinking of Opposed Skill Actions to cover Character vs. Character skill uses that 
doesn't require a Skill Contest. Like using Intimidation on a character would modify the skill 
user's by the opponent's M. Defense. 
<Hiro> Or something similar.
<Hiro> The classic example of an Opposed Skill Action would be the use of a Weapon Skill.
<PoeticJustice> Wouldn't it usually be Whoever Does it Best Wins?
<eldersphinx> PoeticJustice: Not when one character isn't using a skill. Do you resist being 
Intimidated by using your own Intimidation back?
<Hiro> If both characters had the Intimidation skill and were using it in a stare down, that'd 
be a Skill Contest.
<PoeticJustice> Hmmm....good point...I'd say the call would be a Spirit check....but it should 
probably be spelled out in each skill...which might be what you're talkin' bout, Willis...
<Hiro> I was thinking of something simpler than a Spirit attribute check. Maybe simply use the 
resisted attribute x 2 as a modifier.
<PoeticJustice> Simple is goood....
<PoeticJustice> So each skill would have an attribute that resisted it?
<PoeticJustice> Or just Intimidate and similar?
<Hiro> It could simply be what the skill defaults to.
<Hiro> In some cases, it might need to be spelled out. This could be done by puting a slash and 
having what it's resisted with. ie, Intimidation (Strength/Willpower).
<Genoce> Any objections if I stick my mounted combat rules into the ToM?
<eldersphinx> None at all.
<PoeticJustice> It would make sense, there, with the mounts...can't use mounted combat without 
'em...
<Hiro> Especially considering the CR never had mounted combat rules. :p
<Demonic_Gerbil> Question:  Are we going to have all the palette-swapped versions of monsters 
with their own templates for leveling, or are we going for generic ones like Bomb and set up 
the templates so the Palette swaps (Grenade, etc.) and their different abilities are derived 
from this master template?
<Genoce> The palette-swapped versions are essentially higher-level creations using the same 
basic template.
<Hiro> Essentially the format is along the lines of- group monster description, template, pre-
made monster stats, template powers, monster stats, powers, repeat.
<Genoce> By the way, feel free to fudge the MCS if you want. 
<Genoce> I do. 
<Hiro> Elisha: That's the plan. There will be stats for Bombs, Grenades, and Explosives.
<Demonic_Gerbil> That's what I figured, just wanted to make sure. :)
<Hiro> I'm also goofing a tad with the format. I think this might settle a problem M & I have 
been forseeing for Vol. 1 as far as the templates taking up too much space.
<Genoce> We can use the reduction in file size to sneak in some additional artwork.
<Genoce> For something like the ToM, it might be advisable to include a few visual aids, 
provided they don't end up ballooning the file.
<LordMagius> After I get the stats finished, and the tome uploaded to the files section, we can 
pick over the format.
<Hiro> M: if you have any ideas for lowering the size, I'd be happy to hear them.
<Genoce> Chop the graphic in half, for one.
<Genoce> That, and more efficient formatting.
<Genoce> Anyway, should we consider this issue covered for the time being?
<eldersphinx> More than likely.
<eldersphinx> I can't see anything that should be discussed immediately here.
<Genoce> All right. That brings us to our next topic of discussion:
<Genoce> Playtesting.
<Genoce> This is a particularly crucial issue, as I see it.
<Hiro> To put it bluntly, it's high time we went about getting some serious playtesting done to 
figure out where the system stands- what needs to be fixed or changed.
<Hiro> One avenue for at least performing stress tests (ie, seeing how combat handles at high 
levels) could be done using IRC to do it with.
<Haeru> I'll go for an IRC game...
<Genoce> What we'd need -- I worked this out earlier -- is a laundry list of professions that 
need testing.
<Genoce> Summoners would be at the top of the list.
<Haeru> Combat is still a tad slow on IRC, but it works out within a few hours, depending on 
the scale of the fight...
<Genoce> Yeah. 
<Genoce> And a lot faster than having to plot every move by e-mail.
<Hiro> I've seen IRC games that cover as much in three hours as it would take three months over 
PBEM.
<Genoce> All we'd need then is a GM and a confirmed group.
<Genoce> And a meeting time.
<Hiro> Pending on how things work out, maybe run the game every other sunday or Monday. Sunday
& Monday are the days I have off work.
<PoeticJustice> Monday probably works best for me....weekends are busy....
<Genoce> Monday evenings...?
<Hiro> Plus with an IRC game, we can post logs to the site. New gamers can see from them how 
gameswork.
<Genoce> Yeah, that's been one request we've been getting.
<Hiro> Might make for a new intro to the GM Guide when it starts falling into shape after the 
CR is completed.
<PoeticJustice> An IRC game is DEFINATELY a good idea....it's one step away from being in the 
same room.
<Haeru> Monday would work just fine for me.
<Hiro> Save for time zones. 
<Genoce> Hm.
<Genoce> What times does everybody have open?
<Genoce> I can try to squeeze something in.
<eldersphinx> I don't get home until after 6 PM, Pac time...
<Hiro> Any time sunday or monday works for me. Friday and Saturdays are possible, but I'm not 
going to have much time.
<PoeticJustice> So any time Monday.
<Genoce> OK, let's settle on a GM.
<Hiro> I recommend Rodger.
<eldersphinx> I'd take the job, but I probably have less free time than most.
<Genoce> Unless we do it tag-team.
<eldersphinx> OTOH, the other people whose talents I'd recommend also have little free time. :)
<eldersphinx> You and Rob, as the primary suspects. :)
<Hiro> Tag-Team might be feasible, pending on the storyline. Having two GMs would be a good way 
to make sure either one gets burnt out.
<Genoce> Provided there's some kind of consensus.
<Genoce> Plus we can throw in higher-level professions as NPCs controlled by either GM.
<Haeru> I have free time, but I feel notorious for being unable to focus on too many games at 
once...
<Genoce> I don't think that'll be such a problem.
<PoeticJustice> And it also allows to experiment with different game styles, a bit...
<Hiro> I think M & I should be able to work something out.
<eldersphinx> It strikes me that we may need more than one playtesting group. Making sure that 
the Level 30 Summoner works is a lot different than making sure that the Level 60 Summoner 
works, frinstance.
*** killerb255 has joined #returners
<Adam_Sama> Brandon!
<Deathcrow> Hello Killer.
<Genoce> Hey, Brandon.
<Hiro> That's more or less 'stress testing'. I was thinking about doing that as well as a 
campaign over IRC.
<Hiro> So. Playtesting is in pretty decent shape. Now, do we want to do a regular campaign as 
well as the stress test?
<Genoce> We could use it to flesh out Era in the process, too.
<PoeticJustice> Good point, M.....it'd work pretty well...
<PoeticJustice> Well, the Era thing.
<Hiro> The Stress Test likely will be M or me coming up with the stats for different jobs at 
different levels. Kinda like the test some people might remember me doing ages using Lucas to 
test new HP formulas.
<PoeticJustice> The rest....well, we could always play a campaign of multipule stories at 
once...
<Jeff> There's the possibility of doing it SaGa style (shudder).
<Jeff> Basically, there's one story arc, and the characters are at whatever level for it.
<Jeff> Then, months or years later, there's another, and their levels are raised to X.
<Hiro> Because the Stress Tests only involve combat and let us get the data we need quickly.
<Hiro> I was thinking simply generate the characters and some monsters and let them duke it 
out. 
<eldersphinx> Let's see how it works. If we need more setting, we can always add it in.
<PoeticJustice> True, too...Stress Tests don't really need story at all.
<Adam_Sama> Well, it looks like I'm out on the playtesting gig.
<Hiro> Right. We just need the cold hard data.
<killerb255> Well, I'm just catching up, so are they're going to be set jobs to choose from...
<killerb255> ...namely, the ones that have changed...
<killerb255> ...or do we pick?
<Hiro> brandon: THat's more or less what'll be. Most of the character will be the one's we've 
had trouble with like the Summoner, Knight, Rune Knight, etc.
<eldersphinx> Back onto topic? Does anybody have a suggestion for playtest material?
<Genoce> Pretty much everything.
<Genoce> Summon System is at the top.
<Genoce> Maybe I'm just exaggerating its importance.
<Genoce> But it does need to be tested.
<eldersphinx> Okay. Meet me here at 6 PM Pacific, Tuesday?
<eldersphinx> 30th level PCs, as many as are welcome?
<Haeru> Any favored classes?
<Genoce> Let's see. What's recently been changed to a somewhat playable state?
<eldersphinx> Just about anything, looks like. The Mimic may be a good choice, if nothing 
better suits.
<Genoce> Ninja...
<Hiro> We have a Berserker, Magic Knight, and Summoner.
<Genoce> And a Chemist.
<Hiro> I'll play a Bard.
<eldersphinx> the Dragoon and the Thief are also obvious candidates, as may be the Archer.
<Genoce> Archer's not done yet.
* Demonic_Gerbil is Berserker. URKA!
<Adam_Sama> Summoner for meee!
<killerb255> I say Charge and Aim as two different commands for the Archer.
<Hiro> I say go with five for the first session. We can come up with more later.
<Haeru> I'll be a Mimic.
<eldersphinx> Alright. 30th-level characters, 40 points in starting stats, and, say... 30,000 
gil for equipment.
<killerb255> ...how many CP?
<killerb255> nm...that'd be about 600 CP, unless that changed?
<Adam_Sama> How many summons? >.<
<Genoce> As many as your MP can handle.
<Hiro> For HP/MP, there's the formula for high level characters for determining HP relatively 
easy if I could remember.
<killerb255> Level x
<killerb255> (10 + Vitality + 1 die roll lower + Vitality/2)
<Hiro> (300 x 0.30) 
<killerb255> right?
<killerb255> Oh, okay.
<killerb255> Roll 30 times?
<Adam_Sama> That's what I say.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Oh yeah, we're using the new equipment tables right?  Where can I find a copy? 
:p
<Genoce> Well, let's get a quick list of the most critical stuff.
<Genoce> The new lists are definitely at the top of the pile.
<Genoce> I'm going to have to cut out a few of the kind-of-in-limbo writeups like Blaster 
Edges, but Throwing Weapons, Two-Handed Swords and Explosives will definitely be available.
<killerb255> I'll purposely try to munchkin with the Dragoon, then that'll tell me what needs 
changing.
<killerb255> The only thing I can think of is High Jump...
<killerb255> ...combined with Reis's Wind...
<Hiro> We could state Reis' Wind doesn't work while using Jump.
<killerb255> ...how about any Regen spell as well?
<killerb255> ...say that Regen doesn't regenerate while in the air.
<Genoce> Well, no effects are calculated while in the air.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Why wouldn't it?
<Genoce> 'E-game logic'.
<killerb255> ...or simple anti-munchkin abuse.
<killerb255> ...kinda the same reason Dragon Spirit only works once per round.
<Haeru> Power of the Dragon overrides other things?
<Hiro> 'dramatic hang-time'
<killerb255> ...otherwise, they would have permanent Life 3/Auto Life/Reraise.
<Haeru> While jumping, they cannot regenerate, due to all their energy being focused towards 
the jump?
<killerb255> So all status effects get slowed down in the air?
<Genoce> Yeah, I guess you could spin some tale about the expenditure of 'ki' or 'dragon 
energy' or what have you.
<killerb255> ...or Reis just doesn't like airborne Dragoons (lame, but I can think of something 
else).
<killerb255> BTW, I'm trying to remember if Freya can Regen in the air...
<killerb255> ...or Kain, for that matter.
<killerb255> How about if, by chance, a Dragoon does get knocked out of the air with a long-
range weapon or a spell targetted at the Dragoon in the air...
<killerb255> ...they fall and take damage?
<LordMagius> I don't think they recovered in the air, however, if the effect was placed while 
they were on the ground, it did remain in effect.
<Haeru> Suspension, in other words.
<killerb255> BTW, M.  What do you have regarding the Gambler writeup?
<Genoce> I'm about ready to pass it onto someone else. My plate's about as full as Rob's.
<killerb255> I'll do it.
<Genoce> I've been using the excuse that I wanted to use Elemental Wheel as the 'X-Slot' 
Ability, though.
<killerb255> It'll probably have more remakes than the Dragoon and Thief put together, 
considering the immense ideas that came from the list.
<killerb255> ...right now, I'm thinking of going with the canon first, then add stuff in to 
balance.
<killerb255> So far, we have Setzer and Cait Sith as main canon.
<killerb255> ...with Wakka and maybe Selphie as other.
<killerb255> Which basically leaves possible powers as:
<killerb255> Slot Machine: Setzer, Cait Sith
<killerb255> Dice: Cait Sith
<killerb255> Magic Slot: Selphie
<killerb255> Weapon Slot: Wakka
<killerb255> ...as well as any list ideas.
<Genoce> Well, if you've got information I don't, go right ahead.
<killerb255> ...the only thing about Magic Slot is justifying that a 
<killerb255> ...Gambler would have any form of magic.
<Genoce> I suppose it can be worked out.
<Genoce> I'll leave that in your hands, though.
<killerb255> Ok.
<Genoce> I'm confident you'll do OK.
<killerb255> Thanks.
<Genoce> Uh, I think Rob's got something to bring up.
<Adam_Sama> Rob now has the floor.
<Hiro> Well, since things have quieted down I might as go through with a very big proposal that 
I want to bring up to your attentions. I was hoping Rodger & Jeff would be back in time for 
this, but pending on the kind of reception it gets, the discussion/proposal willl move to the 
list. Before you go off the handle, keep in mind that I AM aware that I am not the owner of the 
FFRPG and will not do this unless I have the support of the Returne
<Hiro> That said, the proposal is none other than this: retitling the next version of the Final 
Fantasy RPG as the Returner Engine. Before you go flood me and brandish weaponry, let me 
explain why I'm bringing this up six years into the game's development. :p
<Hiro> Ever since we (the Returners) managed to drag the FFRPG back into development after the 
original founders dumped it, there have been a number of people that have wanted to use the 
game system for non-FF stuff. I can remember as far back as early '98 people coming forward 
wanting to do worldbooks for games like Wild Arms or Suikoden. 
<Hiro> I even went as far as trying to do a spin off of the FFRPG system- the original Returner 
Engine system. In the end, it was a good idea marred by bad timing since the project started 
off a few months before the FFRPG Complete (CR 1.0) did. By the time the FFRPG Complete was 
done, it was obvious that the RE system was unnecessary if the main support was going to be for 
the FFRPG.
<Hiro> What I'm proposing will have little serious effect on the game system itself. Most of it 
will stay exactly the same with the Final Fantasy series working as the 'core' of the Returner 
Engine but with the extra flexibility to allow easier coverage of other games provided with the 
proper amount of customization such as rules for race ability, spell, and item construction 
available in the core. 
<Hiro> The only significant change *may* be for chapters one and seven (Character Generation & 
Magic) and even that depends on the discussion the game gets. As Chapter One goes, I'm thinking 
of using just four basic jobs- Warrior, Mage, Expert, and Adept. Abilities would be determine 
through sets you could purchase like a Dragon Arts set or a Thief set. These would depend on 
what job the character has.
<Hiro> As for Magic, to remove the white magic/black magic moniker, spells would reorganized by 
category. You would have for instance, Elemental magic, Non-Elemental Magic, Healing Magic, 
Support Magic, etc. 
<killerb255> Well...it doesn't sound like a bad idea, I guess if the FFRPG and the Returner 
Engine remain separate entities, despite the similar rules.
<killerb255> ...basically 50-60% of both would be cut and paste from each other.
<killerb255> ...maybe 70% if need be.
<Haeru> Well, there's the basis of the FFRPG... the skills and stat system..
<Genoce> It'd be more in line with a heavy duty WBG aid, as I see it.
<Haeru> That remains consistent between FFRPG and Returner, yes?
<killerb255> ...but the rest of it is changes needed to make the GURPS-like feel of what the 
Returner Engine is supposed to accomplish.
<killerb255> I'd say finish 2.5, THEN make the Returner Engine.
<Hiro> That might be the best way to go about it. But the Returner Engine would retain nearly 
everything that makes the FFRPG tick. The only difference will be some changes to the system 
and most of those will be minor. 
<Hiro> I see it as a natural development. In this way, the system itself is more tied to the 
'company/group'. One of the spectres that always been at our back has been Squaresoft showing 
up one day and telling us to remove the FFRPG.
<Hiro> I'm not about to see six years of development go down the tubes.
<Hiro> And four years of my life.
*** Jared has joined #returners
<Jared> Heheheheheh.  What was on today's agenda?  
<LordMagius> You probably don't wanna know.  :)
<Jared> Yes I do.  Was the beastmaster destroyed?
<Genoce> No.
<Hiro> What's the point of having the Beastmaster if it takes *days* to gain his powers if 
other jobs get them automatically?
<Jared> We can probably shave that time to hours.
<eldersphinx> Here's the question. Can we give the Beastmaster some kind of schtick that makes 
it different from a Blue Mage, without trapping it?
<eldersphinx> Here's a thought about a way to limit a Beastmaster's abilities without a time 
lag. What if we gave the Beastmaster 'free' learning ability - no time lag, no inactivity 
required - but only within a particular type of terrain, or against a particular type of 
monster?
<eldersphinx> So at character creation, a Beastmaster might choose to be a Forest-dweller, say. 
He can learn Rages, through whatever mechanic, against any monster that he fights in a forest - 
but nowhere else.
<Jared> Very nice.
<Jared> It's also canon in a way-Gau could only learn rages on the Veldt.
<killerb255> You know what?  That's not too shabby.
<killerb255> ...but still, monster rages are somewhat underpowered anyway, considering that 
monster attacks don't do nearly as much damage as PC attacks.
<eldersphinx> ... That's a thought for a high-level Beastmaster ability, though. Some kind of 
'Shapechanging' talent, into a monster form that the Beastmaster's already learned a Rage for.
<killerb255> ...they're not underpowered for a monster, but they are for a PC.
<Hiro> Especially given that it would debend strongly on what kind of monsters the character 
fights and where.
<killerb255> ...if the Beastmaster fights 50-pound weaklings for too long, it's not going to 
get any stronger.
<killerb255> Anyway, I guess Rodger's idea for the Beastmaster combined with the recent writeup 
may make for some satisfactory results.
<killerb255> ...now I need to see the current Mimic writeup to see if it can hold its own.
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> We're pretty much at the end of the line anyway.
<Hiro> I'm guessing (roughly) we might manage to get the CR ready by late September or early 
October pending on how well things go with playtesting. RE might be ready around November or 
early December.
<Genoce> Let's not get too optimistic.
<Genoce> Playtesting may reveal additional problems.
<Hiro> Let's hope not...
<killerb255> Actually, I'm thinking a little bit after FF10's domestic release is where 2.5 may 
be complete.
<killerb255> ...nm.
<killerb255> ...they pushed that to February.
<killerb255> ...it'll probably be done before then.
<Genoce> In which case we'll have to update.
<Genoce> Again.
<Hiro> I think there needs to be a cut-off point for the FFRPG. 
<Genoce> FF10?
<killerb255> 10 sounds like a good point...
<killerb255> ...since it is a happy medium between old and new.
<Genoce> Last one out turn off the lights, OK?
