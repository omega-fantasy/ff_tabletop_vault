*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Genoce
<Genoce> By the way, I'm going to be trying an embryonic Limit Break system on Tuesday. Any 
objections?
<Demonic_Gerbil> I don't have any objections.
<Genoce> OK. Since there's no real mechanics for actually building anything, I'll be parcelling 
them out.
<Genoce> It'll probably skew things a little since LBs really shouldn't be used in conjunction 
with standard Abilities.
<Genoce> But I'm more looking at how often they crop up.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Yeah, if you don't know how common they are, you can't balance them.  ^_^
<Demonic_Gerbil> I've got a version of the dancer with Stat down songs done.  I moved the 
Bard's 3 stat-down songs over, and then made two more up to round out the Dancer to 4 dances 
per level.
<Demonic_Gerbil> I kept the dancer otherwise the same except for adding those 5 songs.
<Genoce> Well, I can't really spot anything overtly wrong about it. Formulas are the original 
Bard's?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Yeah, the effects for the three Bard songs that were moved over are the same.  
However, the COS formula was changed to reflect the other dances (roll against Dance Skill - 
M.Def).
<Genoce> Incidentally, something I've noticed about the Recovery Items -- why are you paying 
six times the price for twice the effect?
<Genoce> Hi-Potion costs 250 and of the latest revision cures 250 HP.
<Genoce> X-Potion costs 1500 HP, but only restores 500.
<Genoce> In other words, you could buy either one X-Potion and restore 500 HP, or for the same 
price buy six Hi-Potions and restore 1500 HP.  
<Genoce> Making X-Potions a complete waste of money.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Oh, I see what you mean.  You pay 6 times more because of the time factor.  In 
combat healing up that extra as soon as possible is more important than saving gil.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Outside of combat Hi-Potions are the better deal (just like in FF games).
<Genoce> Except the fact that a Potion costs 50 gil and heals 50 HP shoots a hole into that 
particular argument.
<Genoce> The jump from Potion to Hi-Potion does not tack on any significant additional cost for 
the healing.
<Genoce> One Hi-Potion is equal in cost and effect to five regular Potions.
<Demonic_Gerbil> X-Potions are supposed to be rarer, so they cost more per unit of effect.
<Demonic_Gerbil> I guess Hi-Potions could be jacked up in price to 300 and X-Potions could be 
dropped to 1000 gil maybe?

*** Adam_Sama is now known as Ixquic
<Ixquic> o.o
*** Captain_Vittles has joined #Returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Captain_Vittles
<Captain_Vittles> Hello
<Ixquic> Greetings!
*** hinayasa has joined #returners
* hinayasa , Mailing list member and GM/player
<hinayasa> hi
<Ixquic> Greetings.
<Ixquic> You know.. I'm tempted to keep Runic Reflex instead of Runic Charge... I would think 
Reflex would be a bit more valuable.
<Ixquic> Not to mention, the RK has more than enough attack powers between Destroy Sword and 
Red Magic.
*** Deamon has joined #returners
<Captain_Vittles> Reflex is better.  Charge doesn't sound like Runic at all.
<Genoce> Hi again, Mike.
<Deamon> hello all
<Genoce> Uh-huh. 
<Genoce> OK. So, I'll work on my Refine system in the meantime.
<Captain_Vittles> Refine?
<Genoce> Alchemy Mk.IV.
<Captain_Vittles> oh
<Genoce> On the plus side, it's about as easy to understand as you could hope for.
<Ixquic> How were we doing Ruins again? A flat five points to a stat, or use a formula?
<Genoce> Formula.
<Captain_Vittles> Formula - 5 points is devastating in the FFRPG
<Ixquic> Ruins do more than simple Breaks, though, right? I can figure something out.
<Captain_Vittles> Unless you have a stat of 30
<Captain_Vittles> Yes, better than breaks
<Ixquic> Hmmmm...
<Ixquic> 20+level/2+STR%
<Ixquic> Breaks have 10+level/2+STR.
<Ixquic> Question. Should I use the same damage modifers for the stat causing Ruins as Mighty 
Sword?
<Ixquic> IE, Soul Ruin (Causes Curse) does 200% damage.
<Ixquic> I'm not talking about the original Ruins.
<Ixquic> I'm talking about Soul and Voice Ruin.,
*** Hiro has joined #returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Hiro
<Genoce> Yes.
<Deamon> you could call Soul Ruin, Soul Burn...
<Ixquic> I'm still tilting towards Voice Ruin. Or maybe Spell Ruin.
<Captain_Vittles> Spell Ruin sounds good
<Hiro> I'd say Spell Ruin.
<Genoce> Spell Ruin it is, then.
<Ixquic> I have an idea for the Destroy Sword Damage. For stat downs, massive damage + five 
point loss to a stat. Magic Ruin, massive damage, half done to MP.
<Ixquic> I may even be able to use Mighty Sword damage progression. >.o
<Ixquic> Any ideas for a CoS? Mighty Sword is a flat 100%... But...
<Hiro> If it hasn't been already pointed out several times, there is a formula for Ability CoS.
<Ixquic> Okay. 85+STR+level/2 chance of the power going off.
<Ixquic> 100-m.def for the status. How about that?
* Hiro slices of the /2
<Ixquic> Well... I was GOING to say a level 20 RK would have a 105% chance.
<Hiro> All abilities have a 100% chance of going off. You can't miss with (say) a Might Sword 
attack (IOW, it'll always do damage). However, the Status Condition can miss.
<Hiro> And that should (85 + Level + Stat).
<Ixquic> Sounds good.
<Hiro> So? A level 20 monster with a Spirit of 10 (M. Defense 40) would knock that down to 65%.
<Ixquic> Anyway. My idea for Destroy Sword is (__)% extra damage, + status. I need to work on 
the details.
<Ixquic> But if I do the extra damage thing, I am going to keep the stat downs to -5. It 
balances out.
<Ixquic> A Knight can take off more.
<Genoce> Yeah, but a Knight doesn't have Red Magic.
<Hiro> A level 50 Knight can shave off 35% of a stat
<Ixquic> It's doubtful -5 that late would amount to that.
<Genoce> Depends on the monster.
<Genoce> Most of them don't push 30 until they're past Level 60 or so.
<Hiro> That would lower a monster with a 30 in a stat down to 20....
<Hiro> I'm starting to wonder if we need to do a little fine tuning to the stat breaks for the 
knights....
<Genoce> Then again, Rune Knights aren't supposed to be the crippling types.
<Captain_Vittles> When do RKs get this power?
<Ixquic> MP Runic, Runic Reflex, Power Ruin, Speed Ruin, Mind Ruin, Magic Ruin, Spell Ruin, 
Soul Ruin.
<Genoce> MP Runic at Level 1?
<Genoce> 1, 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63.
<Genoce> That means Power Ruin is a Level 18 Ability.
<Ixquic> A level 20 Knight can lower a stat by 1/5th...
<Demonic_Gerbil> At level 18 it kicks Power Break's ass if it's a flat -5.
<Genoce> Yep.
<Ixquic> We could shuffle the powers around.
<Demonic_Gerbil> If the Ruins do -5 to any stat, it still kicks the Knight's Breaks asses until 
level get into the 40s and 50s at the earliest.
<Ixquic> I'm tempted to slap MP costs on these too, Elisha.
<Ixquic> What would be a good MP cost?
<Genoce> They're all 20 MP.
<Genoce> In FFT.
<Ixquic> But FFT MP is a tad lower than FFRPG MP.
<Captain_Vittles> If they're gonna cost MP, then the init penalties have to go.
<Captain_Vittles> So I say no MP costs.
<Captain_Vittles> Balance the power, don't just limit it.
<Hiro> No ability should ever have more than one limiter.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Blair: Then why play a Knight when you can be a Rune Knight and do all the 
same tricks and so much more?
<Captain_Vittles> Because a Knight should have better breaks in the end.
<Hiro> Actually, that brings up a good question- the Bard has init penalties and skill 
penalties.
<Captain_Vittles> Skill Penalties?
<Ixquic> I say we slap MP costs on Ruins. And keep them at a flat -5.
<Captain_Vittles> The Rune Knight should *never* have better stat-downs than a Knight.
<Hiro> It has a rule stuck in there for skill penalties. I think the Dancer has something 
similar.
<Ixquic> Or, we could eliminate Power Ruin and make a new Ruin in it's stead.
<Genoce> Power Ruin and Magic Ruin are better than their Break equivalents.
<Genoce> Magic Break and Mind Ruin are equal in power.
<Ixquic> RK is supposed to be anti-mage. Let
<Ixquic> s ditch Power Ruin and give it something else.
<Captain_Vittles> How about a power that lowers Spirit or M.Armor?
<Ixquic> Spirit Ruin.
<Ixquic> But then we're in the same dilemma with the Power Ruin.
<Captain_Vittles> Just change it from -5 to a formula
<Ixquic> Maybe a flat 20%.
<Captain_Vittles> Yeah
<Hiro> That might be okay.
<Genoce> 20%? I guess that could work.
<Ixquic> Spirit Ruin- -20% Spirit, 150% damage. Mind Ruin- -20% MAG, 160% damage. Magic Ruin- 
160% MP damage. Spell Ruin- 180% +Silence. Soul Ruin- 200%, +Curse
<Ixquic> Tada?
<Demonic_Gerbil> If the Ruins do damage, the Knight's Breaks should.  Otherwise what's the 
point of playing a knight if someone can come in and do something almost as well as you and 
throw damage in one top.
<Genoce> Yeah, this was raised on the boards.
<Ixquic> Not true.
<Ixquic> Ruins are limited.
<Ixquic> A flat 20%. Knight Breaks grow with them.
<Hiro> At level 20, the CoS would be the same (ie, 20%). By level 30, it'd 25% (30/2 = 15. 15+
10 = 25) By 50, it'd be 35%.
<Hiro> And god help the monster that goes up against anything higher than that.
<Hiro> I think it might actually be a good idea to include a 'ceiling' for breaks.
<Hiro> Like 30% or 35%.
<Genoce> Since we're speaking of 'ceilings'.
<Genoce> How about putting damage on a 1-HP minimum?
<Genoce> IE: No matter how much damage is inflicted on a target, they will always do at least 1 
HP damage regardless of how much Armor the target is wearing.
<Genoce> In general.
<Ixquic> Makes sense.
<Hiro> Makes sense. Afterall, we have a damage cap for 999 damage attacks.
<Genoce> OK. No objections, then?
<Genoce> I only brought it up because of that last battle, where Rodger had plenty of 0 HP 
attacks.
<Hiro> That came up because 1) Rodger was using monsters 10 levels weeker than the party  2) 
our Armor might be too good.
<Genoce> Hardly seems appropriate for players to be miming 'unmovable objects', tho'.
* Hiro nods
*** Deathcrow has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hi, Crow.
<Deathcrow> hello
<Ixquic> I'm sticking with damage on top of 20% stat reduction/status.
<Genoce> Elisha is more or less done with his Dancer, but it might need a bit of balancing and 
playtesting. 
<Captain_Vittles> What exactly do the improved Dancers do?
<Demonic_Gerbil> The new dancer is the same as the old with the stat-downs from the Bard.  I 
expanded on them with two new ones to round out the # of dances to 4 per level.
<Genoce> The only thing left as a serious undertaking, Core-wise, is the Limit system.
<Genoce> Now, I don't think the current professions should realistically have access to these. 
<Deathcrow> What did you have planned for the limit system?
<Genoce> I'll give you a brief outline.
<Genoce> Essentially, a Limit Break is a partial or full replacement for an Ability 
progression.
<Ixquic> Guys... I really think I'm going to scrap the stat downs and leave those to the 
Knight... It just... doesn't feel right.
<Captain_Vittles> Limit Breaks in the past have been barred from characters made with regular 
classes.  We reserved them for PBCS chars.
<Genoce> Meaning that you can have anywhere between one and ten Breaks. 
<Genoce> These will be purchased under the same principles as any other Ability under the PBCS.
<Genoce> Exception being Limits are cheaper than regular Abilities due to the fact that they 
aren't accessible 100% of the time.
<Deathcrow> Ah! So in a way, when you create your character, you get to choose some of his 
powers and what they do, right?
<Genoce> Exactly.
<Genoce> Assuming we're using the point-based model for building them, that means that the 
player has more points to spend on increasing the damage or effects of the Break itself. 
<Genoce> I advanced to Teirlap the opinion that whatever becomes of the PBCS should orient 
itself to the Magic System.
<Hiro> Only problem I see is this kind of system will be hell to integrate into the existing 
system.
<Genoce> I'd have pegged it as an Appendix.
<Genoce> As I see it, each Ability has its own Level and prerequisites. Let's say we wanted to 
play a Fighter/Thief hybrid. If we wanted Mug, we'd have to buy Steal first.
<Genoce> Or, using any linear set like Destroy Sword -- to buy the maximum Ability in each 
'Ability set', you need to have all the previous Abilities in the series as well.
<Genoce> This allows you to mix-and-match unattached Support Abilities from various 
professions.
<Genoce> While at the same time preventing somebody from taking the best parts of the Knight, 
Fighter, Swordmaster and Dragoon and rolling them into some kind of ungodly Munchkin Knight.
<Genoce> And would be considerably more organised than the current incarnation of the PBCS.
<Genoce> Now, if the player doesn't like the existing Abilities, we can add a small 'PDS' to 
cover the creation of alternate Abilities and Breaks.
<Deathcrow> If they still gain the abilities at the lvl they are supposed to, then, if they 
take all the best abilities, they'll have a very long period of time when they won't gain any 
powers
<Deathcrow> If a player gains all his abilities at lvl 64, then he won't have anything to use 
before.
<Demonic_Gerbil> What if they take all the best low-level powers (Dispatch, Jump, Blitz, the 
first Runic, etc)?  Do they get all of those at level 1.
<Genoce> Not really.
<Genoce> Abilities have to be in a linear progression. 
<Genoce> Think of it as having an advancement chart with 'Level 1: ________ Level 8: _______', 
that stripe of thing.
<Ixquic> Elisha brings up a point. All powers currently in the CR should be put in. Including 
Runics that are going to get chucked.
<Genoce> That's the idea.
<Ixquic> Alright. Just making sure.
<Captain_Vittles> Gambit will live!
<Genoce> Anyway, that's a basic idea of how it will work.
<Genoce> In that scheme, Breaks are essentially restricted Abilities. 
<Demonic_Gerbil> Lets just drop jobs all together and make everything point based.
<Genoce> Actually, under this system, the existing professions are 'templates'. 
<Genoce> IE: If you don't want to use the PBCS, you just flip ahead two chapters and pick out a
 template to use.
<Hiro> Sounds like what I had planned for Returner Engine.
<Genoce> Mmm-hm. 
<Genoce> But this depends on how well-balanced the overhauled PBCS is.
<Captain_Vittles> I was thinking that once I have the final magic lists made, I should make 
some mages templates for the PCom.
<Captain_Vittles> So that a player wouldn't have to plan out their spells to get prereqs if all 
they wanted was to play, say, a defensive white mage.
<Captain_Vittles> OK, as it is now, a mage could get stuck for a particular spell at high 
levels if they don't take the right spells at low levels...
<Ixquic> Basically, Blair is suggesting that several lists or charts showing recommended spells 
be made. 
<Ixquic> Example: A defensive White Mage would have barriers, ect.
<Genoce> Why not add them to the Resources page?
<Genoce> Sounds like the sort of thing that'd be worth having there.
<Captain_Vittles> Wherever it fits, that's where it can go.
<Captain_Vittles> I know it's just making a lazy player even lazier, but not all players want 
to customize their mages.  :)
<Ixquic> Or we could just make a chart listing each spell and their prerequisites.
<Captain_Vittles> That still requires reading through the lists though.  My idea would be a 
list the player follow, i.e. my list would tell which spell to learn at which level.
<Ixquic> If such a chart is made, I suggest it go backwards. Start and level ten, and move on 
backward. 
<Ixquic> I'd be willing to work on such a chart.
<Captain_Vittles> Leave the charts for now, without a finished magic list there's no point.
<Ixquic> All I need to do on the Bard, M, is look over Elisha's Dancer so I can remove those 
powers from the Bard's repetoire.
<Ixquic> Someone mentioned the Bard having to do skill checks and init. penalties. Should I 
remedy that situation?
<Hiro> They need to have one or the other. Not both.
<Ixquic> Keeping init. penalties is likely best. Had we run with the continous play thing, 
skill checks would have been best.
<Genoce> That depends on who can come to each.
<Hiro> I wonder: Since Bard are more focused on the use of their Bard Songs, would it be more 
appropriate to move them to the Adept jobs?
<Ixquic> How's this sound?
<Ixquic> Any single character may be affected by only one stat boosting song at any given time. 
In other words, Urgh the Yeti Beserker may benefit from the effects of Cannon of Might, but may 
not benefit from Archmage's Symphony at the same time.
<Genoce> Works.
<Ixquic> Should I remove the rant about Weapon/Song skills, since skill checks are no longer 
required?
<Genoce> Go ahead.
<Genoce> Can we cover Worldbooks now?
<Genoce> I'd like to clear through the agenda while I still have the opportunity to.
<Hiro> I take it you refer to our Worldbook Revision project?
<Genoce> Yeah.
<Genoce> Specifically, I think at this stage, with the system starting to calm down, we should 
start giving editors a head start.
<Hiro> If they're willing to do anything with their worldbooks to start with...
<Hiro> Which means I need to get off my ass and finish the Worldbook Guide...
<Genoce> I think the Worldbook Guide can be pared down, even.
<Hiro> pared down?
<Genoce> We just need a basic layout for Worldbooks to follow.
<Hiro> Oh.
<Genoce> Frankly, all of that 'tech tables' business is superfluous.
<Genoce> Rob - just cut the WBG down to the barest essentials and release it.
<Genoce> All you need is to list the required sections and content for each.
<Genoce> You also need to explain what does and doesn't make a good Worldbook.
<Genoce> IE: some basic guidelines for choosing settings.
<Genoce> Once that's been released, we can start assembling Worldbook teams for FF5-10. 
<Hiro> Good worldbook: has background material. Bad worldbook: has no BG material and only 
mechanic related stuff to cover the oddball stuff that pops up in the game.
<Captain_Vittles> Well, worldbooks are for after I finish my CR duties.
<Genoce> Anyway, Rob, I think we should try to get the WBG together this week at least.
<Genoce> Rules can be changed, but color text can be applied.
<Genoce> It's important, however, that people understand what is and isn't feasible as a 
worldbook.
<Genoce> FF1, for example, is worthless as a Worldbook because you can't do anything with it.
<Hiro> Hmm. You can go for it I suppose. But I dislike leaving you with another obligation I 
should be handling.
<Genoce> Lord only knows I have enough of them. One more won't hurt.
<Genoce> Anyway, the Worldbook page will in future track various volunteers for each 
supplement.
<Genoce> FF5-10 have priority, but I'll be glad to open it up to anyone who's got something 
ready. 
<Genoce> We should have some kind of proper conversion table once Blair and I figure out how 
Spell Ranges are going to work.
<killerb255> I'm gonna split, guys.  I'm too tired to make heads from tails here, I'll try and 
have a preliminary Gambler writeup this week.
