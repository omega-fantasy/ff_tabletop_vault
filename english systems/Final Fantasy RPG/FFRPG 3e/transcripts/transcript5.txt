*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Hiro
<Genoce> Hey, Rob.
<eldersphinx> Hey Rob.
<Hiro> Hey.
*** Ixquic has joined #returners
<Genoce> Well, well.
<eldersphinx> Alo, Adam.
<Ixquic> Okay. I'm going to send this to everyone ahead of time.
<Ixquic> A couple things.
<Ixquic> There are no ranges yet. I'm working on deciding on those now. Init penalties will 
be added in at a later time too. I'm looking through the CR to get ideas about them.
<Hiro> There's a conversion scheme for the ranges. 
<Hiro> btw, M, does that same conversion rate cover 'Effect' as well?
<Genoce> No. Blair and I were discussion Effect the other day.
<Genoce> We settled E:2 at 4 to 8 meters, but haven't decided on E:3 and E:4.
<Ixquic> And instead of going with 1/10th of the damage restoring MP, we switched to MP cost. 
So, if a RK absorbs Fire, they get 4 MP back.
<Ixquic> However, Destroy Sword is not canon. We went with statuses instead of stat reductions. 
Stat reductions are the Dancer and Knight's forte.
<Ixquic> So far, there have been no problems with the ability set as is.
<eldersphinx> Alright. First note - Destroy Sword needs ranges.
<Genoce> Real ranges.
<Ixquic> Mighty Sword ranges could work.
<Genoce> Just use the old ranges and convert them to meters.
<eldersphinx> Question: If we're rebuilding the ranges anyway, can anybody think of a reason to 
not rebuild the ranges from the ground up?
<eldersphinx> Well, I was thinking that for spells and similar effects, we'd probably have 
better luck defining a person's "full move", and then figuring out how many rounds a person 
charging a mage would be under fire.
<eldersphinx> Okay, assume that a person can move (10+Speed) meters per round.
<Genoce> Uh-huh.
<eldersphinx> If a Fire1 spell has a range of 15 meters, then a mage can only get off one spell 
before the enemy charges, gets to point-blank range, and knocks the mage down.
<Ixquic> 1 hex equals how many meters again?
<Genoce> It doesn't equal anything, Adam.
<Genoce> It's a non-fixed rate of conversion. 
<eldersphinx> If the spell has a 30 meter range, the mage can cast two spells. And so on.
<Genoce> Let me see. 
<Genoce> Fire 1 has R:4.
<Genoce> Using the conversion chart...
<Genoce> R 4           21 - 40
<Genoce> We can assume around two or three Rounds of fire at that range, in other words.
<Genoce> HEX RANGE      METER RANGE
<Genoce>    R 8          251 - 450
<Genoce>    R 7          101 - 250
<Genoce>    R 6           71 - 100
<Genoce>    R 5           41 - 70 
<Genoce>    R 4           21 - 40
<Genoce>    R 3            3 - 20
<Genoce>    R 2      Extended Melee (2)
<Genoce>    R 1          Melee (1)
<Demonic_Gerbil> You know, if you're giving guns 100+ meter ranges, spells and class powers 
should have them too otherwise everyone will just use guns and spend weeks at a time lying in 
wait for the perfect shot.
<Genoce> You realise that guns are restricted and bow ranges are STR-dependent, right?
<Genoce> And those are the maximum ranges.
<Genoce> Attacking at anything above Safe Range means that you incur hefty firing penalties.
<eldersphinx> IMHO, one of the major advantages of spells (or a disadvantage of guns, if you'd 
like) is how cover comes into play.
<eldersphinx> With a spell, you point at a location, and the spell effect bursts from that 
point. With a gun or projectile weapon, you have to have a straight line from the gun muzzle 
to the point you're trying to hit.
<Genoce> Unless the target is completely covered.
<Genoce> You'd need LoS to hit anything with a spell.
<eldersphinx> So if there's someone crouched behind a wall, and you have a gun, you're SOL. But 
if you have a Fire2 spell handy, you can bring the spell up just above the enemy's head, and 
toast him.
<Ixquic> Another thing we should talk about soon is my idea about spreading spell effects.
<Genoce> Or indirect targeting. 
<Genoce> 'Barraging', so to speak.
<Genoce> It's like artillery fire. If you have something with E:2 or E:3, you could try hitting a 
target in cover by firing a shot at a point adjacent to it.
<Hiro> How would this be handled in game terms?
<Genoce> Just saying that E:2 and E:3 effects don't need an LoS.
<Hiro> Sounds sufficient.
<Genoce> Incidentally, if nobody's got any objections, let's quickly work out a conversion scheme 
for E.
<Genoce> How large would you say Ultima's area of effect is?
<Genoce> 20 meters?
<eldersphinx> How about this for an E: conversion? (Hexes)^3 meters.
<eldersphinx> E:2 would be an 8 meter diameter effect.
<eldersphinx> E:3 would be 27 meters.
<eldersphinx> E:4 would be 64.
<eldersphinx> Round as desired.
<Genoce> Let's round it to this.
<Genoce> E:2 4-8 meters.
<Genoce> E:3 9-25 meters
<Genoce> E:4 26-60 meters
<Hiro> Well, Ultima would certainly be able to nuke a city block with those kind of ranges.
<Genoce> It *is* supposed to be the ultimate magic.
<Genoce> And it's preferrable to the 'living room Ultima' the last edition had.
<eldersphinx> I mean, it's not Lavos' Awakening or anything, but...
<Ixquic> It's no small chunk of change either.
<Genoce> If a Mage character reaches Level 60 or so, they should have something to show for it.
<Genoce> This does raise another question.
<Genoce> Should we assume those 'all allies' recovery items and effects automatically have E:60?
<Hiro> Woah.
<Genoce> Or E:30.
<Hiro> This could be a big problem for groups in melee. 
<eldersphinx> The question of how Focused and Unfocused abilities work is also going to start 
mattering here, I think.
<Genoce> All spells are inherently unfocused.
<eldersphinx> According to FFT. In the other FF games they were distinctly non-Unfocused.
<Genoce> That's because there was no opportunity for friendly fire in those games.
<Hiro> Right. Good guys on the right, bad guys on the left.
<Genoce> You never got somebody in the middle of the enemy ranks after making an attack, after 
all.
<Genoce> That's because there was enough of a theoretical divide between the two.
<Hiro> That mystical line where characters have to leap over to hit their opponent.
<Hiro> Keep in mind that combat in the FFRPG isn't like the majority of the FF games. There is 
no enemy & ally sides and the mythical line that divides the two that the heroes must leap over 
to hit their opponents.
<Genoce> You'd have to be stupid to stick around inside a Mage's area of fire, considering you 
can move before and after an attack.
<eldersphinx> Elisha - Even if all spells are unfocused, a mage who aims carefully can take out 
several opponents.
<eldersphinx> Take the following line:
<eldersphinx> Hmm. Nevermind the map attempt. Say you have a line of PCs in melee with a line 
of monsters. Three on each side.
<eldersphinx> If each character or monster takes up an area 2 meters square (and that includes 
room to maneuver, swing weapons without poking allies, or so on), the fight's six meters wide 
by four meters deep. A Fire2 spell would catch the entire fight, if dropped in the middle of 
it.
<eldersphinx> But if the same spell was dropped 5 meters *behind* the fight, the three 
monsters would all get caught, the PC in the center of the line might catch a bit of the edge, 
and neither of the other 2 PCs would be touched.
<Hiro> Or, Mages could be given the option to tone down the area of effect.
<Genoce> Didn't we already give Mages the ability to adjust the effects of their spells?
<Genoce> This was Rodger's idea.
<Genoce> In that case, this is a non-issue.
*** Captain_Vittles has joined #Returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Captain_Vittles
<Genoce> Hey, Blair.
<Captain_Vittles> hello
<Hiro> We've been discussing the Effect stat for spells and some other range related stuff in 
general.
<Genoce> We actually don't need a range profile for caster-only.
<Captain_Vittles> I assume that 4-8 meters mean a radius of 4-8 meters?
<eldersphinx> Radius, or diameter?
<Genoce> Actually, radius might be a bit excessive.
<Captain_Vittles> Radius, because it's easier to target
<Genoce> Then you should probably hack the numbers in half.
<Genoce> So if we're using radii, it'd look more like this.
<Genoce> E:2 2 - 4
<Genoce> E:3 5 - 15
<Genoce> E:4 16 - 30
*** lime_boi is now known as Limeboi
<eldersphinx> ... Though as a thought, would a penalty to the spell's MDC maybe work better?
<Captain_Vittles> Example time
<Ixquic> 2/3rds after MDC is what I say.
<eldersphinx> Blair - I'll run a set of numbers too, if you don't mind.
<Captain_Vittles> Firaga on one target - 100 damage.  Firaga split to attack many targets - 
66 damage
<Hiro> I think it'd be easier to calculate 2/3s of the damage rather than MC. 
<Captain_Vittles> Though by reducing MDC, the mages could have a set Single Target MDC and 
Multi Target MDC
<Hiro> Hrm. That means keeping track of two different MDC stats.
<Captain_Vittles> How do you split MDC x1?
<Genoce> A Mage wouldn't have MDC x1 by the time he got to split spells, would he?
<eldersphinx> Here's an example of FFRPG rules using a straigt 2/3 damage split.
<eldersphinx> Fire2 - 4d6 damage, Magic 16. MDC x4.
<eldersphinx> ST average damage: 14 + 16 x 4 = 120.
<eldersphinx> MT average damage: 14 + 16 x (8/3) = 80 to each target.
<Captain_Vittles> I have the lowest spells being splittable
<eldersphinx> -40 damage, but hitting a 4-meter area instead of a 1-meter area. Quite fair, 
IMHO.
* Captain_Vittles nods
<Captain_Vittles> And I can get around the MDC x1 thing by making low level spells single 
target only
<eldersphinx> Or possibly rule that they *can* be cast as MT, but only by mages with MDC 
x2 or better.
<Captain_Vittles> Too many rules.  I'd rather just have them single target.  Besides, how 
many low levels mages fight excessive numbers of monsters?
<eldersphinx> Anybody think that not allowing mages to MT before they reach Level 8 is going 
to break the game?
<Hiro> It'd be easier to just make them single target. By the time most mages get x2 or x3, 
they'll be close to being able to using LVL 3 Magic.
<eldersphinx> The new Primary progression gives mages Level 2 spells at Level 9, yes?
<Hiro> Another thing to keep in mind- most mages aren't going to be doing much damage with 
LVL 1 magic.
<Captain_Vittles> The new one is at 8.  :p
<eldersphinx> A lucky (and good) low-level mage will do 18 damage with a Fire1 - that would 
split to 12 damage under the current system.
<Hiro> Not that much damage when you start factoring in M. Armor.
<Captain_Vittles> Might as well leave them as Single Target.
<eldersphinx> So under the current system, mages get Level 2 magic and MDC x2 at the same 
time. Sounds like a good place to put the first ST/MT spells...
<Captain_Vittles> Level 2 just introduces the stronger spell 'families', like Poison and 
Water.
<Hiro> Think of a LVL 5 monster (LVL x 1 M. Armor) w/ SPR of 5. 10 M. Armor right there.
<Captain_Vittles> Ummm, are Rune Knights supposed to get to Level 6 Red Magic?
<Captain_Vittles> The spell progression says 4, Adam's prototype says 6.
<eldersphinx> I wouldn't mind allowing Paladins and Dark Knights to have Level 6 magic, 
actually.
<Genoce> If we go with 6, it'd mean getting rid of a few Abilities.
<eldersphinx> Cecil's (limited) spell selection did include Remedy and Exit, after all.
<Captain_Vittles> I'd rather just limit their magic.  :p
<Genoce> And strictly speaking, wouldn't that make them Adepts rather than Fighters?
<Captain_Vittles> I'll just start splitting spells at spell level 3
<eldersphinx> I would like to see mages get *some* option to split a spell before Level 18 
or whenever they get spell level 3 magic... but hey.
<Captain_Vittles> Level 15
<Hiro> I don't think there are many multi-target at levels 1, 8, or 15.
<eldersphinx> I think the General has a couple of powers that MT.
<Genoce> Can I give a quick note about 'multi-targeting'?
<eldersphinx> M: Sure.
<Genoce> OK. In technical terms, a multi-targeted Spell wouldn't actually allow you to 
choose multiple targets.
<Genoce> It would be more like this.
<Genoce> You select a target.
<Genoce> Then everything within (E) meters of the targeted point gets hit.
<Captain_Vittles> But having the single/multi difference means you could take a spell that 
would normally hit allies and monsters, and focus it on one monster for better damage.
<Genoce> I don't mean that there wouldn't be a difference, Blair.
<Genoce> I'm just pointing out how 'multi-targeting' essentially works.
<Captain_Vittles> You don't need a map to say "everything within 4 metres gets hit"
<eldersphinx> It may be a good idea to rename "Multi-Target" to "Area Target" to clarify 
matters, and to help people make the switch.
<Captain_Vittles> good idea
<Genoce> Seconded.
<Captain_Vittles> Look at the way it's set up right now.  The spells hit an area, but you 
need a map to put a quantity on the area.  This way, we're eliminating the map.
<Demonic_Gerbil> But you'll still need a map.  Unless the GM wants to define everyone's 
position relative to each other without a map to show it.
<Genoce> That's not that hard.
<Genoce> That's about par for any pen-and-paper RPG, Elisha.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Maps and "you're all here, they're all there" are so much easier to 
manage. ;-)
<eldersphinx> Face it, if we put the combat system into numbers, we're never going to meet 
anybody who actually runs all the calculations.
<eldersphinx> But we *will* be providing the best common ground between the "Take the numbers
 and set up a map" crowd and the "Look at the numbers, wing all the ranges, and trust the GM's 
judgement" crowd.
<eldersphinx> Providing a system that's easily flexible in *multiple* directions is more 
important, IMHO, than providing a system that fits really well into only one style of combat.
<Genoce> Seconded. 
<Genoce> You can always shave off layers of detail as needed.
<Genoce> It's easier to drop things than it is to build them up.
<Genoce> Related question: what about V?
<eldersphinx> Straight conversion to meters up/down, just like E.
<Captain_Vittles> You know, E could handle V
<Genoce> I'm wondering if V isn't superfluous.
<eldersphinx> Blair: But we don't necessarily have perfect spheres for all effects.
<eldersphinx> Skean bursts, for instance, would likely cover an area in an 8 meter radius from 
the burst point, but only go "V" by 2 meters tops.
<Genoce> But bear in mind that 'height levels' aren't really going to be as neat as they were 
in FFT.
<Captain_Vittles> This leads to one of my ideas...
<eldersphinx> It may be possible, with Effect areas, to define 'vertical' in terms of a spell 
shape rather than a meter measurement.
<Captain_Vittles> All spells (and powers I suppose) could be written as Type R:? E:? V:?  
Example: Firaga - Sphere R:X metres E:X metres (No need for V in this case).
<Hiro> Like giving each spell a V rating equal to its LVL/2.
<eldersphinx> Blair - You caught my thought. A spell with a 'Circle' area would be a flat 
circle burst, a 'Sphere' would have a maximum height equal to its horizontal radius, etc.
<Genoce> This gets back to what we discussed a while back, Blair.
<Captain_Vittles> Skeans would be Circle (R:? E:? V:? less than E)
* Captain_Vittles nods to M
<Captain_Vittles> Quake would be Circle with V:0
<Genoce> Shouldn't be that hard to get a quick 'vocabulary' of effects together and convert 
accordingly for V.
<Genoce> So, we've got Circle, Sphere, Beam...
<Genoce> Pillar?
<Genoce> Something meaning that it's the same V everywhere...
<Genoce> Like Meteor.
<eldersphinx> Cone is something of an off-the-wall possibility, as well.
<Genoce> Saturate?
<Genoce> 'Pillar' sounds silly in that context.
<Genoce> I'm more inclined to say 'Saturate'.
<Genoce> Meteorites don't really discriminate.
<eldersphinx> Pillar, V: Infinite may work better as a separate type of area effect.
<Genoce> Yeah, because that implies it's a solid mass of an effect.
<Genoce> 'Saturate', on the other hand, is more of a steady bombardment.
<Captain_Vittles> Pillar will be rather limited.  How many spells use it?  One Light and one 
Dark spell I think...
<Captain_Vittles> Though Pillar could apply to 'enchantment' spells, like Might or Aura.
<Genoce> What's the point? They're single-target anyway.
<Genoce> This would only be the case for area effects.
<Genoce> In case of a single-target, the V component is incorporated in the range.
<Captain_Vittles> Single Target would just be listed as Single Target, R:Whatever.  And Caster 
would just be listed as Caster.  :p
<Genoce> No need to have a whole range profile just for something that's caster-only.
<Genoce> We should write this up together with the conversion notes for hex scale and release it.
<Genoce> Do you want to write up the types?
<Genoce> We already have the straight R/E conversions.
<Captain_Vittles> What are we using?  Circle, Sphere, Pillar, Caster, Single, Saturate...
<eldersphinx> Beam.
<Genoce> I don't think we have any cone effects...
<Genoce> Some spell effects could theoretically be cones.
<Genoce> Magic Breath comes to mind.
<Genoce> Or Megaflare.
<Captain_Vittles> Though you could easily say Bahamut flies in and toasts an area with a Saturate 
or Pillar effect.
<Genoce> Anyway, that about covers the range issue. 
<eldersphinx> On to Job discussion?
<Genoce> OK.
<Genoce> What professions need to be covered today?
<Genoce> Adam wants Bard time.
<Genoce> Let's start with that.
<Ixquic> Okay.
<Ixquic> Rob wants more beneficial status songs.
<Hiro> In particular, I think the Bard could use songs that have the same effects as Protect, 
Shell, and (Possibly) Reflect. 
*** KillerB has joined #returners
<Genoce> Brandon.
<Genoce> Hey.
<KillerB> Hi
<Genoce> I'm fifty-fifty on that. 
<Genoce> We don't want to turn the Bard into a singing White Mage.
<Captain_Vittles> The Haste song should be higher.
<Hiro> The Song of Hermes shoudl be LVL 6 or LVL 7.
<KillerB> The Haste song should be at least a higher level than that of the White Mages' song 
levels...
<eldersphinx> If the Bard gets songs that act as Protect and Shell (Level 4, say?) but no Barrier 
or M. Barrier, it has a significant disadvantage over White Mages. Would you rather chain-ST a Bard 
Song, or cast a single Barrier WM on the party?
<Captain_Vittles> The barrier type spells are changing though
<Genoce> Yeah, Blair tightened up the lineup a little.
<Captain_Vittles> Protect blocks 1/2 physical damage.  Barrier blocks 1/2 physical damage for a 
group.  Wall blocks all physical damage for one.
<eldersphinx> I think I'm working off of your change, right Blair? Barrier is now Protect MT, 
and M. Barrier is Shell MT? And both Barrier and M. Barrier would be the exclusive property of 
White Mages?
<eldersphinx> I like the idea...
<Ixquic> Okay. Life 3 is out, Protect and Shell are in.
<Hiro> More varied attack songs.
<eldersphinx> I wonder if the Bard could have some anti-Status abilities, protecting himself only.
<Genoce> Anti-Status?
<Genoce> That's Chemist domain.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Leave the elemental attacks to the Dancer please.  ^_^
<Captain_Vittles> A Nameless Song to balance the Nameless Dance would be good.  Song Level 8, roll 
1d10 for beneficial status.
<eldersphinx>Are you thinking about a Song with effects similar to the Marvel Shoes accessory?
<eldersphinx> One thought - we may want to give the Nameless Song a smaller Initiative Penalty 
than most Level 8 songs.
<eldersphinx> I mean, why sing Nameless Song with a -16 Init penalty when you can sing Haste Song 
(say), use a -14 Init penalty, and get the exact status you want?
<eldersphinx> I expect that unless a Bard specifically chooses his Song progression to avoid status 
effects, he'll have songs that specifically target the most useful status effects that Nameless 
could provide, by the time he gets Level 8 songs.
<Ixquic> So the Bard has a random multiple status song, and an all stat booster at the Eighth level.
<KillerB> As for the initiative penalties themselves, I don't think any of the songs, 8th level, 
for example, should be as powerful as, say, a Level 64 standard ten-string ability...
<KillerB> ...given that 8th level songs have a -16 penalty, and the average Level 64 ability has a 
-20.
<KillerB> I think the song progression is the exact same progression as the old progression for a 
Red Mage and a Magic Knight.
<Hiro> More like new progression for the Red Mage.
<Ixquic> May I point out that the songs use MDC? Bards have lower MDC than DC. Most ultimate 
abilities use the Job's main 
<Ixquic> So, it balances out.
<Captain_Vittles> If they don't get it until Level 64 or so, and are forced to use MDC, then the 
best songs can be on par with the better job abilities.
<Ixquic> They get it at 63.
<Ixquic> But we're assuming they'll pick attack songs.
<eldersphinx> I think we can assume that most Bards will take at least one Level 8 attack song, 
sometime.
<Ixquic> I don't see any reason to lower damage for them though. Bards have a low enough MDC to 
balance it out.
<Hiro> I'm tempted to say that Bards should get +1 every 8 LVLs for MDC.
<eldersphinx> Bards are as good at singing as Red Mages are at magic?
<eldersphinx> I can see it.
<Hiro> I would say so.
<Ixquic> okay. In that case, may I move on to the Rune Knight?
<Genoce> Yes.
<Captain_Vittles> Level 6 Red Magic is too high.  They already have a full string of abilities.
<Ixquic> Level six magic, or a loss of two powers?
<Captain_Vittles> Level 4, because it's easier than balancing spells, plus (typing)...
<Captain_Vittles> Red Magic only goes to level 8.  If the Rune Knight gets Level 6 with less powers, 
it still makes them better than a Red Mage IMO.
<Captain_Vittles> Level 4 magic is mostly pointless after a certain XP level.  But that's where the 
job abilities get better.
<eldersphinx> Level 4 White magic is fairly useful in a non-combat supporting role.
<Captain_Vittles> M made a good point earlier - higher spell levels make them Adepts rather than 
Fighters...
<Demonic_Gerbil> The Dark Knight only needs Level 4 magic for early levels, after that it has 
enough crushing power without a boost.
<KillerB> ...as for L4 White with a Paladin, that's enough curing power for them considering the 
sheer power of their Holy Sword skills.
<Ixquic> I revamped Destroy Sword.
<Ixquic> Stat reduction is the Knight and Dancer's area, not the Rune Knights.
<Ixquic> So I made Destroy Sword into something decidely anti-mage.
<Genoce> Moving on...
<Genoce> Brandon, I think you want to have a little brainstorming time for the Gambler.
<KillerB> Sure.
<Genoce> First of all, what are we looking at?
<KillerB> ...Jared does have a good point regarding Slots: it is hard to hit the exact same number 
three times in a row.
<eldersphinx> Admittedly, if you have one slot power for every 3-of-a-kind, the probability of 
getting *something* good goes up quite a bit.
<Genoce> In that case, your best bet is to minimise the possible spread.
<Genoce> Here's a suggestion: 3d6.
<Genoce> You have 6 possible 'pictures' right now.
<eldersphinx> 1 in 36 chance of getting a 3-of-a-kind, some kind of 3-of-a-kind.
<KillerB> 3d6 was proposed before, but the chances of getting the exact number three times in a 
row has decreased greatly.
<Genoce> Not if you add some alternative combinations.
<eldersphinx> If additional powers of "2 of one kind, 1 of anything else" were available, the odds 
of something good would go up dramatically.
<Captain_Vittles> Most of Setzer's and Cait Sith's 3 of a kind powers were very rare.
<Genoce> The multiple 'Wheels' are one point of contention.
<KillerB> ...the problem is where the Gambler gets the wheels from if that is a tool for progression.
<KillerB> ...purchasing is most logical, but expenses can get in the way.
<Genoce> I'm not too hyped about the prospect of purchasing, but my objections are already on the 
record.
<KillerB> I agree with your objections, but the Gambler is already a compulsive spender anyway. :)
<KillerB> ...as for having rare combinations of symbols, I did give the Gambler the ability to 
"Do Over," much like FF8's Selphie.
<Genoce> How about making *each usage* of the Ability cost something?
<KillerB> ...again, that doesn't address where the Gambler gets their wheels from.
<Captain_Vittles> Pay per use could be good.
<KillerB> ...if it's a -10 penalty.
<KillerB> ...for every Do Over.
<Genoce> Yeah, but how about 'Thievery'? Where does the Thief get their trapped chest from?
<KillerB> ...the trapped chest isn't as tangible of an object as, say, a Gambler slot machine.
<Genoce> Brandon - the slot machine doesn't actually need to be physically there.
<KillerB> If it doesn't need to be physically there, then I'm all for a progression for wheels.
<Genoce> Mm. Simplest way of doing it, as I see it, is to go into a 'bigger risks for bigger 
payoffs' kind of model.
<Genoce> With prices increasing with the power of the Wheel.
<Genoce> IE: The more money a Gambler has, the higher their power will be.
<Hiro> It would be a good idea to include the variable damage formulas similar to the ones 
used in the 2.1 Gambler.
<KillerB> The damage formulas will remain the same.
<Captain_Vittles> But then we do what Rodger said, and make 2 of a kind mean something
<KillerB> Rodger and Blair's idea of two of a kind is in.
<KillerB> ...and this also goes with M's idea of two HITS or YEAHs on the Consecutive Attack 
Wheel.  That's in, too.
<KillerB> Do Overs are also in, at a -10 penalty, so the Gambler can have a little bit of 
insurance, but can still get his ass kicked if he Do Overs too many times.
<Genoce> What about pay-per-spin?
<KillerB> I dunno.  Will the amount increase the probability of different symbols, or would it 
be a flat fee?
<Genoce> Flat fee per wheel was my suggestion.
<Genoce> Rather than purchasing a 'wheel' wholesale.
<KillerB> I'll go with the more divine/make believe slot machine, so they can't crack it open. :)
<Genoce> Never mind the encumberance issue with hauling a slot machine around.
<KillerB> Well, I guess with two of a kind, Do Overs, and whatnot, paying per spin may be too 
much of a hinderance.
<KillerB> ...they already have to pay with Coin Toss.
<KillerB> ...which that alone would make almost EVERY luck power obsolete if they all require Gil.
<Genoce> Unless you want to simply go for a Level-based Wheel progression.
<KillerB> If it's level-based, then a tangible slot machine wouldn't be acceptable, since they'd 
have to get their wheels somehow.
<KillerB> ...so it'll be intangible.  Sorry Engineer fans. :)
<KillerB> ...unless you can come up with a good explanation for a tangible slot machine with 
wheels that account for an expense weakness...
<Genoce> It's either Level-based or pay-per-spin, as I see it.
<KillerB> Pay-per-spin doesn't explain where the wheels come from on the machine, but then again, 
you can spend more money to use the more expensive wheels, though.
<Genoce> One-off purchases of class-defining Abilities are difficult to balance.
<KillerB> How about I write up two different versions of the Gambler, and see what everyone agrees 
on, all factors considered.
<Genoce> Go ahead, Brandon.
<KillerB> However, the gist of both will get:
<KillerB> Chocobo Wheel, Moogle Wheel, Consecutive Attack Wheel, Elemental Wheel,
<KillerB> ...Status Wheel, Lucky Seven, I'm debating on Gambit (just for Blair. :) )
<KillerB> ...that's more than enough abilities for a Gambler, even without Cards.
<Captain_Vittles> You shouldn't put the friendly fire and natural HP restrictions on it.  Just do 
what M suggested on the list and make it a Reaction ability.  That way the Gambler doesn't have to 
waste a turn on variable damage, the other PCs will never hit him to activate it, and natural HP 
doesn't matter.
<KillerB> BTW, should Magic Slot be a wheel option or should it remain with the explanation 
regarding "The Gambler has tapped into Magical powers, however, he lacks the control that 
specialized Mages muster"?
<Genoce> Wheel.
<KillerB> Ok.
<KillerB> I guess there could be three numbers on the Magic Wheel: 0, 1, and 2.  Whatever adds 
up, is the Red Magic spell level the Gambler will cast.
<KillerB> ...as for which spell, goes back into the Summoner random mechanic issue...
<Genoce> Make a table or something.
<KillerB> Ok.  Also, EVERY Luck power has the Do Over option.
<KillerB> Again, it's a -10 penalty for each Do Over, so it's not overly munchkinous, especially 
with enemies attacking the compulsive Gambler.
<Ixquic> -10 is pretty hefty...
<Demonic_Gerbil> I can just see how that's going to work:  out of combat, the Gambler sits there 
and "do over"s until he gets Lagomorph.  Over and over...  until the party is healed back up again.
<KillerB> You can't push it too far, anyway, because two or three Do Overs is basically a turn 
forefit, unless the Gambler is in Haste.
<Ixquic> -10 per Do Over.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Just axe "do over". Only Selphie could do it.  None of the other gamblers could.
<KillerB> I could limit Do Overs.
<Genoce> Extremely easy limitation there, Elisha. 
<Genoce> Make Slot have to target something.
<Genoce> With Lagomorph being an accidental result.
<KillerB> You can only Do Over a number of times equal to your Magic or Spirit/3.
<KillerB> ...per round.
<Genoce> Ten times maximum?
<Genoce> Per round?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Per day or something.  Gamblers can't get too much insurance.
<eldersphinx> A better fix on the Lagomorph-Do Over problem may be to remove Lagomorph, rather than 
Do Over.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Pay per use will eat the Gambler money up and he will just use Dice all the time 
instead.
<KillerB> The reason I'm insistent on keeping Do Overs is because of using d6s, even with
two-of-a-kinds, your chances of getting something good is all too rare.
<Genoce> How about making Do Overs Level-based?
<Ixquic> Level/11+1, perhaps?
<Genoce> Level/11+1? That's a seriously ugly set of numbers, Adam.
<Genoce> How about just saying:
<Genoce> 'The Gambler starts out with one 'Do Over' and gains one additional 'Do Over' every 11 
Levels'?
<Captain_Vittles> If you're playing a character with random powers, then they shouldn't be expecting 
do overs at all.  It's a job hazard...
<KillerB> Not really.  Do Overs give the Gambler some sort of chance at being useful, not too much 
of one.
<Genoce> If you need a further limitation...
<Genoce> Say you can only Do Over one particular spin per Round.
<eldersphinx> If for nothing else than to keep the campaign from ending on a 1/216 roll.
<KillerB> ...and again, you can't Do Over if the penalty takes you to Initiative 0 or less, unlike 
other Initiative-based abilities.
<Genoce> So, where does this leave us?
<KillerB> Well:
<KillerB> Slot Machine: 6 wheels.
<KillerB> Dice
<KillerB> Coin Toss
<KillerB> Lucky Seven
<KillerB> Possibly Gambit.
<KillerB> ...a perfect 10 string. :)
<KillerB> ...and Bribe
<KillerB> ...instead of Gambit, maybe.
<Genoce> OK. 
*** miamiw has joined #returners
<Genoce> My mechanics worked slightly differently, though.
<Genoce> Hi, Mike.
<Genoce> I essentially said the Mediator should 'make an offer'.
<Genoce> IE: The player writes down how much gil he's willing to spend.
<Genoce> Then the GM checks it against the monster's Level.
<Genoce> HP, I mean.
*** Sephorus has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hi there.
<Sephorus> Hey.
<Genoce> If it's HP x 2, then the monster leavs.
<Genoce> Rodger, what's next on the agenda?
<eldersphinx> Dancer. Elisha?
<Demonic_Gerbil> So, everyone like my dancer?
<eldersphinx> I would like to see the d20 ditched. The curve that it generates can cause balance 
problems.
<Genoce> Not to mention the game doesn't officially use d20 anymore.
<Demonic_Gerbil> So instead of 2d20, 4d10?
<KillerB> 4d10 is good. :)
<KillerB> ...especially since it makes the minimum two points x DC higher.
<Genoce> So you even get a bonus.
<eldersphinx> BTW, on Sword Dance and Wiznaibus, is there *any* chance that the power will miss?
<Demonic_Gerbil> No, but there's no chance that there's a critical either.
<eldersphinx> Well, the power itself is *already* a critical, so...
<eldersphinx> I mean, I could see a Dance roll versus target Mdef, realistically.
<eldersphinx> Brandon: Compare Sword Dance to Quadra Slam. Similar total damage (one strike at 
x2 versus four strikes at x1/2) and add into the account the fact that Sword Dance only goes to 
Armor once.
<eldersphinx> And Wiznaibus hits all opponents.
<Demonic_Gerbil> But the Dancer has to roll a level 3 dance to use Sword Dance.  And a level 4 
dance to use Wiznaibus.
<Genoce> 'All opponents'?
<KillerB> ...how about 150% (or +50%) extra damage.
<KillerB> ...as for Wiznaibus, I don't think he means "all opponents" in its truest sense.
<Genoce> Put an effect on it.
<eldersphinx> How about the following mechanic for Sword Dance and Wiznaibus: Make a Dance check 
- MDef. If successful, 2x normal damage. If failed, 1x normal damage.
<eldersphinx> And from the Wiznaibus power description, Any target with 20 hexes of the user 
who is 
<eldersphinx> currently hostile towards the character (this does not include 
<eldersphinx> opponents under the effect of Flirt) takes damage as if struck by 
<eldersphinx> Sword Dance, without the ability to Defense the attack.
<eldersphinx> That's fairly explicit.
<Demonic_Gerbil> But Rodger, the Dancer already has a 1 in 6 chance of doing a regular attack 
when it dances.  Now if it uses Sword Dance you want them to have a chance to do the "FAILURE" 
attack again?
<KillerB> That is right.  The Dancer is a random character.  At least the Swordmaster can control 
when he wants to use Quadra Slam...
<eldersphinx> No, I don't want them to do Failure. I want them to do 1x normal damage, no chance 
for the opponent to dodge.
<eldersphinx> Consider that the Dancer has a 1/6 chance of Sword Dancing as early as Level 10.
<KillerB> Ok then, I'd say switch Sword Dance with a Rank 3.
<eldersphinx> And that by Level 30, the Dancer has a 2/3 chance of being able to pull either Sword 
Dance or Wiznaibus... and that their alternative power is a Level 5 in that case.
<KillerB> Sorry, Rank 4.
<eldersphinx> If Sword Dance was a Rank 4, and Wiznaibus was Rank 5, I could go for the powers 
in their current forms.
<eldersphinx> As they stand, there's far too good a chance that they'll break a game somewhere.
<KillerB> I guess moving Sword Dance and Wiznaibus up a rank would be in order then?
<Demonic_Gerbil> Moving them screws up the ranks.  The level 4 and 5 dances are too strong to be 
moved down.
<Demonic_Gerbil> And I want to keep an even 5 dances per rank.
<KillerB> +50% extra damage for Sword Dance instead of x2.
<eldersphinx> Nameless Dance could potentially be a Rank 3, and Temptation Tango in the Rank 4 
slot.
<eldersphinx> Or +50% damage.
<KillerB> ...as for Wiznaibus, what's the current damage formula for that?
<eldersphinx> Wiznaibus is Sword Dance on all opponents. Within 20 hexes of the Dancer.
<Demonic_Gerbil> What's E:20 converted to meters M?
<Genoce> ...too damn much.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Why don't I make that 20 meters instead?
<Genoce> OK, 20m.
<Genoce> Incidentally; Adam, Elisha - ranges should be converted with the next release of your 
relevant writeups.
*** Andrew`` has joined #returners
<KillerB> E: is easy enough.  What is the formula for R?  I know you stated a chart, but it's easier 
for me to remember things with a formula.
<Genoce> There is no formula.
<Genoce> I based it off the weapon ranges.
<KillerB> Alright.  I think it'd be best to post, publicly, on the list (and maybe the board), the 
charts for all three.  Again, I'll need the vertical ranges in order to submit the latest Dragoon, 
Thief, and Gambler writeups.
<Genoce> There aren't Vertical ranges to speak of.
<Genoce> The new model looks like this:
<Genoce> (Type) R:x E:x
<KillerB> So V's gone?
<eldersphinx> It's subsumed into the spell Type.
<Genoce> For example, Sphere R:40 E:28 means that the center of the effect has V:28.
<eldersphinx> Circles have an effective V:1; they're basically bursts that hug the ground.
<Genoce> Saturate is V:oo
<Genoce> Etc.
<KillerB> So the syntax for, example, Dice could be Range: Circle 20 meters?
<Genoce> Circle R:20 E:(whatever)
<Hiro> That sounds rather cumbersome.
<Hiro> Why not: Range: R:20 E: X (Circle)
<KillerB> Oh, okay.  So the visual text will still use :type: - R: E:, but the numeric values will 
be in Meters then...
<eldersphinx> I like putting the spell effect type after the effect value myself.
<Genoce> OK. Let's handle it that way, then.
<eldersphinx> One other comment on Effect types: We could potentially have multiple effect types in 
the same spell for added fun. For instance, canon Bahamut ZERO from FF7 would have E: 2 (Saturate), 
60 (Circle).
<KillerB> So Bahamut ZERO's explosion Teraflare beam would be the E:2 saturate, whereas the explosion 
would be E:60 circle then?
<eldersphinx> Yep. Fun to visualize, huh?
<KillerB> I guess Dragoon Jumps could either be saturates, or spheres with an insane E:
<Genoce> Dragoon Jumps are single-target.
<Genoce> What happens when the Dragoon Power Jumps in a room with a four-meter ceiling?
<Genoce> Aside from badly concussing himself.
<eldersphinx> Heck, forget about that question - what happens to a Dragoon who's elbow-crawling 
through a 1/2 meter high tunnel and gets into a fight?
<KillerB> ...well, there's the balancing factor for High Jump and Power Jump. :)
<Genoce> You need enough room to use it.
<Genoce> Maybe put a minimum 'headroom' on both.
<KillerB> ...and the Dragoon has other abilities to use as well:
<KillerB> Cherry Blossom, Dragon Breath, etc.
<KillerB> ...and Reis Wind in case he gets pounded in a tunnel and needs some way to heal. :)
<Genoce> What's next?
<KillerB> How about the Fighter?
<Genoce> Fighter does need to be covered at some point, though.
<Genoce> Monster Trainer, too.
<eldersphinx> Any ideas on Fighter at this time? Or move on?
<Genoce> We can adopt some Limit Breaks.
<KillerB> Yeah, someone did mention putting Mighty Sword on the Fighter.
<KillerB> Actually...
<KillerB> ...if the Knight's breaks do damage, then Mighty Sword can die here. :)
<eldersphinx> The Fighter always has been the one Warrior class that didn't have any flashy ranged 
stuff, and didn't push any of its powers through a specific weapon.
<Demonic_Gerbil> Add two more powers and *boom* you have a ten-string.
<KillerB> Destroy the Fighter altogether may not be a bad idea.  They were basically pre FF3j 
Knights.
<eldersphinx> The role of the Fighter class in the FFRPG is as a template.
<Genoce> The old Fighter was the professionless Fighter.
<eldersphinx> It's the one class you can play if you want to run an Axe-wielder, a Hammer-user, a 
Boomerang expert...
<eldersphinx> Are we ready to move on?
<KillerB> Sure, what's next?
<eldersphinx> Advantages and Disadvantages.
<Genoce> OK, guess this is 'suggestion box' time.
<eldersphinx> M has a list of new Ads and Disads, and we're making some modifications to some old, 
broken ones.
<Genoce> Basically, the culling of Ads and Disads is taking place on three levels.
<KillerB> I was going to say that we need more advantage suggestions than disadvantages.  Last 
time I checked, we had more disads than ads.
<Genoce> Well, the disads are being stripped, too.
<Genoce> Too many of those are 'free Advantages'.
<KillerB> Yeah, I'll admit guilt to using a disadvantage as a free advantage, and some of my players 
have, too.
<Genoce> The GM input I've gotten from this has been a big help.
<Genoce> For example, the rampant abuse of 'Family Heirloom'.
<Genoce> First are the 'free Advantages' among the Disadvantages (stuff like Rebellious Spirit). 
<Genoce> Second are the useless Advantages like 'Absolute Timing'.
<Hiro> Which means anything involving role-playing oriented advantages & disadvantages...
<Genoce> No, not really.
<Genoce> Just the ones that are flat-out worthless compared to their fellows.
<KillerB> Known Criminal is a role-playing oriented disadvantage, and it's a very balanced one at 
that.
<Genoce> Or Phobia.
<KillerB> ...Strong/Weak Alcohol Tolerances are Ad/Disads respectively.
<Genoce> Got those already.
<Genoce> As a basic guideline for Advantages/Disadvantages -- they shouldn't be something that's 
replicated by a Skill or profession Ability. 
<Genoce> For example, 'Danger Sense' is essentially 'Awareness', the Skill.
<Genoce> Oh, Old and Young got moved out of Disads.
<Ixquic[AFK]> To...?
<Genoce> Character Concept.
<Genoce> For those who want to play characters outside of the recommend age range.
<Genoce> As Adam pointed out, there's no actual *Disadvantage* to being Old or Young.
<Ixquic[AFK]> You give something up, but you get something back.
<KillerB> What are we looking for regarding ads and disads?  Should they be:
<KillerB> 1) Combat related?
<KillerB> 2) Non-combat related?
<KillerB> 3) Role-play related (probably not, as per Jeff's paraphrase.
<Ixquic[AFK]> 4) All of the above.
<KillerB> Oh well.  The more I think about it, the more I think that Ads and Disads are just 
Skills with another name.
<KillerB> If they are, then we could keep the Disads, and make them CP bonuses...
<KillerB> ...since there are always more Disads than Ads...
<Genoce> Ads != Skills.
<KillerB> Maybe I shouldn't have implied that 100%.
<KillerB> ...but at least 50% of them are Skills with another name.
<KillerB> ...and those 50% should be addressed.
<Genoce> Chances are they got hit in my first wave of slash-and-burn editing if that was the 
case.
<KillerB> Ok.
<Genoce> What did we want to ask Blair again?
<KillerB> The $500 question is: will Magic Knight receive Shock?
<Captain_Vittles> As they stand now, they don't need it.
<KillerB> Will they be discharging their spells out of their swords to account for range, or 
should this wait until the full writeup?
<Captain_Vittles> As it stands now, they get 2 types of spells - one type grants an elemental 
to their weapon (a la FF5) and I'm considering allowing those enchantments to be discharged.  
the other type is Steiner-esque attacks - the Magic Knight dashes forward and strikes for extra 
damage, but the weapon doesn't keep a permanent element.
<KillerB> As it stands, that sounds like a good balance, Blair.
<Genoce> Next issue?
<eldersphinx> I'm not sure we ever fully got into the Skills and CP issue.
<eldersphinx> Are the Skills and CP available to characters as they gain levels fair? If not, 
how do we change it?
<Genoce> Well, Skills are problematic twofold.
<Genoce> One: most of them are uselss.
<KillerB> As being someone who has ran a campaign to Level 99, I haven't had any problems with 
CP balance...
<KillerB> ...aside from the uselessness, as mentione.
<Genoce> Two: the CPs are too limited to improve anything more than the basic 'essentials'.
<KillerB> mentioned.
<KillerB> ...I should scan one of my player's character sheets and show you.
<Ixquic[AFK]> I agree with M.
<Hiro> There's several other factors that 2.5/R&E is going to bring up. One would be the 
introduction of Knowledge Skills. 
<eldersphinx> Okay, IIRC characters get 20 CP per level. One CP raises a skill by 1%; ten CP 
raise skills by 10%.
<KillerB> ...but yeah, about 50% or more of the Skills are useless, unless the campaign is more 
roleplay than combat.
<eldersphinx> And ten CP also raise a stat by 1 point, come to think of it.
<eldersphinx> I may be able to do something on an independent Artist, given a couple days to 
think and write.
<Genoce> Go for it, Rodger.
<KillerB> Ok, Rodger.  Looking forward to it.
<Genoce> I was going to haul in the Berserker for 'balancing'.
<eldersphinx> Good call on the Berserker.
<Genoce> I suppose I should release the new Chemist to the list at some point.
<Genoce> There's not that much there, other than the fact that Throw Potion and Throw Item now 
just allow them to-- I'm inclined to believe that Berserkers get on just fine without Titan 
Crusher, Adam.
<Ixquic[AFK]> Titan Crusher is weaker than most ultimate abilities.
<eldersphinx> Not backed up by DC it isn't.
<KillerB> ...one can say the same with Elan, but that's backed up by the sheer power of Two Swords 
and Throw.
<KillerB> ...as well as multitargetting all other abilities.
<eldersphinx> Which would you rather have - a 11d6 attack with a x7 bonus, or a 10d6 attack with 
a x10 bonus?
<Genoce> Berserkers are already insanely powerful.
<Captain_Vittles> Mind Guard is useless.  How could a Berserker be confused if they're berserk?
<Genoce> Are you automatically immune to Charm and other Mystify effects if you're Berserk normally?
<eldersphinx> Well, if the Berserker is overpowered, do we need to *add* a power to replace Mind 
Guard?
<Genoce> No. 
<KillerB> Another question: does a Berserker need a ten-string?
<Genoce> Probably not.
<KillerB> ...they're basically just a pound-the-hell-out-of-everything Job, and doesn't need much 
in the way of abilities.
<Genoce> For no delay or MP cost.
<Hiro> Do they need the +50% HP bonus?
<eldersphinx> Not when its main power - Berserk - stacks with every other power it's got, basically.
<Genoce> +25, surely?
<Hiro> I thougth it was +50%.
<Hiro> I guess I'm wrong.
<Genoce> Even if it was, +50% is insane.
<eldersphinx> I'd like to send the Worldbook Guidelines across the channel real quick.
<eldersphinx> Anyone here not had a chance to see M's guidelines?
*** Morbieus has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hi, Robert.
<Morbieus> Hello
<Genoce> Like I said the other day -- there's not really that much to discuss.
<Genoce> If you disagree with the guidelines or need something clarified, just say so now.
<eldersphinx> M - I do know that many people - including me - managed to miss the returners2 list.
<Genoce> That's why it's been linked to in the FAQ, Beginner's Guide and Worldbook pages on the HQ.
<eldersphinx> Web subscription can be done at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/returners2 for anybody 
who's interested.
<Genoce> And Rob should update the welcome message to mention it as well.
<Captain_Vittles> I've got no comments for now.  I only skimmed the article, as I'm not writing 
any WBs right now.
<KillerB> Hmmm...are there any other Jobs that haven't been addressed yet that need to be?
<Genoce> Aside from the Fighter and the Artist?
<Genoce> I think we've got the lot, pretty much.
<KillerB> As for the Black Belt, was there a suitable replacement for Spiraler?
<KillerB> Let's look at the possible choices:
<KillerB> No Mercy: maybe.
<KillerB> Demi Shock: random gravity damage.
<KillerB> Curse: debilitator, I think this was ruled out a while back.
<Captain_Vittles> Random gravity damage makes no sense.
<Captain_Vittles> Gravity is a definite thing, eg 1/4 HP, 1/2 HP
<KillerB> So we have No Mercy, Demi Shock (out), Curse (most likely out), Countdown/Secret Fist,
<Captain_Vittles> No Mercy seems best.
<Hiro> I think Demi Shock is the best replacement, IMO>
<Morbieus> I like the Demi Shock idea
<KillerB> Demi Shock's % could depend on the Black Belt's level.
<Hiro> We can make it non-random.
<Hiro> ie, Demi.
<Hiro> 50% off.
<KillerB> There's enough projectile abilities: Aura Bolt, Fire Dance, Air Blade.
<KillerB> Demi Shock may be the most unique.
<Morbieus> We just need to think of the formula
<Hiro> Not to mention they already have Four physical attacks.
<Hiro> Five if you count Counter.
<Morbieus> What level would Demi Shock be gained at?
<Hiro> 57.
<Captain_Vittles> I suppose Demi Shock could work, but no random crap.
<Captain_Vittles> Just a flat 50% HP cut
<Morbieus> Just have it do a higher amount as you get higher in level
<KillerB> Damage could either be a formula or it could be equal to the Black Belt's Level, 
Diablos style.
<Hiro> It is called *Demi* Shock. Giving it the ability reduce the opponent's HP by 50% wouldn't 
be out of the question.
<Captain_Vittles> They're not Time Mages.  50% damage is a gift.
<KillerB> ...then again, that reminds me:
<KillerB> ...are there any Gravity abilities (percentages of damage) on our current non-Mage, 
initiative penalty dependent Jobs?
<Hiro> Nope.
<Hiro> Another possibility is move up some of the lower powers and put in Demi Shock around the 
5th or 6th slot.
<KillerB> ...but with Minus Strike and Dragon Breath in the fray now, that may not be the case 
anymore.
<KillerB> ...so a flat 50% damage restriction isn't a complete "must".
<KillerB> ...but if it works, it works, I guess...
<Genoce> What are the modifiers, if any?
<Hiro> 55 + (LVL) + (Stat)
<KillerB> For Demi Shock?
<Morbieus> What stat?
<Genoce> SPR.
<Hiro> We need to settle Magic vs. Spirit for Job abilities. 
<KillerB> Isn't Magic used for modifiers, while Spirit for bonuses?
<Hiro> Magic is supposed to be the 'offensive' supernatural attribute.
<KillerB> I thought all "ki" related powers had Magic as a modifier, while Spirit is a stat for 
determining MP bonuses?
<Genoce> That makes SPR kind of useless.
<Genoce> I thought SPR was the standard 'chi' stat.
<Captain_Vittles> Str - physical damage.  Vit - physical defense.  Mag - magical damage.  Spr - 
magical defense.
<Morbieus> Unless yout need MP why would you need a high SPR
<Genoce> Magic should be restricted to Spells, in my opinion. 
<KillerB> I guess Magic = spells, Spirit = ki-like abilities and other non-spells?
<miamiw> Luna does
<Genoce> The Samurai uses SPR.
<KillerB> IOW, if it uses MP, use Magic.  If not, use Spirit.
<Genoce> SPR does need more usage, though.
<Genoce> If it's just a way to get more MP...
<Hiro> Another point: Spirit has some relevance due to M. Armor & M. Defense. Magic doesn't.
<KillerB> It should be even use w. Magic = stuff that uses MP; Spirit = stuff that doesn't.
<KillerB> even use = even balance.
<Hiro> A non-magic using Warrior Job like a Fighter or Dragoon doesn't need to ever increase 
his Magic stat.
<KillerB> Yeah. :)
<Genoce> Considering MAG = intelligence...
<Genoce> Yeah, I can buy that.
<Genoce> Didn't the General use SPR, too?
<Genoce> Mm. Well, it was a thought.
