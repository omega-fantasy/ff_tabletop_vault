-> *chanserv* op #returners Genoce
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Genoce
<Genoce> Quick question. 
<Genoce> What does everyone think of having two grades of Status weapons?
<Captain_Vittles> Two grades?  As in FFX style Attack and Buster?
<Genoce> Aye.
<Genoce> Basically, it'd just mean an increased CoS.
<Genoce> We don't have to do it, but I just thought of it.
<Captain_Vittles> But a shorter duration.
<Genoce> Or same CoS, increased duration.
<Captain_Vittles> It could work.  It would make a high-level status weapon worth taking.
<Genoce> Well, I'm skewing the Status Conditions anyway.
<Genoce> I'll save it for the actual talk.
<Captain_Vittles> Skewing?  I hope this won't affect my spells...
<Genoce> It just means the better Status Conditions come later.
<Genoce> OK, I'm just going to leave it at that. I'll have to do a lot of lateral thinking if I 
want to work in weapons like Tri Edge and Ascaron.
*** Hiro has joined #returners
*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Hiro
<Captain_Vittles> yo
<esphinx_afw> Heya.
<Ixquic> Yo.
<Genoce> Hello, Rob.
*** esphinx_afw is now known as eldersphinx
<Ixquic> Well, if we're going to keep these ridiculous prices for Robes, I think we need to 
toy with the AR and MAR values. I mean, each different piece of armor only offers a few 
extra points of protection. Which isn't much.
<Hiro> We could probably the same about all armor.
<Genoce> Say the same, Rob?
<Captain_Vittles> Rob has a point.  All forms of armor don't increase by much when moving 
up the line.
<Genoce> How much difference do those 'points' make?
<Ixquic> Little to none.
<Angel242> At 5 points per armor jump? It might add up
<Genoce> Just do the same thing we did last time.
<Genoce> Two characters.
<Genoce> Same level.
<Genoce> Same VIT.
<Genoce> Two grades of Armor.
<Ixquic> Of the same type, I would assume.
<Genoce> Obviously.
<Ixquic> Give me five minutes.
<Genoce> OK, let's say 2 Level 30 Fighters. 
<Genoce> VIT 15.
<Genoce> Wearing Mail.
<Genoce> Against an attack doing 150 damage.
<Ixquic> Stone Skin included?
<Genoce> No.
<Genoce> While we're waiting for that, let's look at the weapons again.
<eldersphinx> Hmm. Here's an argument. A Level 30 character, wearing nothing but Clothes, 
has better Arm and MArm stats than a normal person wearing a Red Jacket.
<Genoce> That's down to the way Rob changed the armor formula.
*** Jeff has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hi, Jeff.
<Genoce> Adam, what have you got for us?
<Ixquic> Fighter 1 is wearing Platina Mail. He has a total of 51/41.
<Genoce> Right.
<Ixquic> Platina Mail costs 4480.
<Jeff> 'Lo.
<Ixquic> Fighter 2 wore Shield Armor. Increasing both stats by TWO.
<Ixquic> For a difference of...
<Ixquic> 4380.
<Ixquic> You pay 4380 more Gil for an upgrade of two points.
<Ixquic> Fighter 1 takes 99 damage. Fighter 2 takes 97.
<Genoce> Anyway, if we could cut to the core of the issue here -- the problem here is the 
same as with the weapons.
<Genoce> The prices are increased independently of the capabilities.
<Genoce> Problem 1: Weapon and armor increases are disproportionate to their actual 
performance.
<Genoce> Problem 2: Weapon and armor prices are too low in general.
<Genoce> Now, Problem 1 would be dependent on changing the pricing structure around 
on a performance-based rather than slot-based model.
<Genoce> As it is, the next weapon in the series may actually be less powerful than the 
previous.
<Genoce> Since things like Elemental Affinities and Random Effects are scattered randomly up 
and down the progression, there is no actual correlation between what you pay and what you 
get.
<Genoce> For instance, take the Enhancer.
<Genoce> You pay 9600 for that.
<Genoce> You get +2 MAG, +2 SPR.
<Genoce> Now, the next weapon in the series is the Falchion.
<Genoce> You pay 14400 for that.
<Genoce> And you gain +1 damage.
<Genoce> In all actuality, we can strip all weapon lists down to four weapons.
<Genoce> 1d[x], 2d[x], 3d[x], 4d[x].
<Genoce> No-frills, no special attributes, nothing.
<Genoce> Each of these four grades of weapons has a number of variants.
<Genoce> For instance, the 2d10 sword, Mythril Sword, is the 'basic sword'.
<Genoce> Then you have the Twilight Sun. 2d10 damage, added Random Effect: Blind* at 
an additional cost.
<Genoce> Or, for a few hundred gil more, Ice Brand, with Random Effect: Blizzard and Ice 
Affinity.
<Genoce> You can throw in +1 damage or +2 damage to go with the effects.
<Genoce> As a freebie.
<eldersphinx> Like the Blood Sword and Force Saber, only for everything...
<eldersphinx> M: Actually, the +1 or +2 damage effects could probably work as straight STR 
bonuses...
<Genoce> Good point, Rodger.
<Ixquic> So, these would all be seperate weapons. 
<Genoce> Yes.
<Genoce> I'm just using the term 'variant' because it's slightly easier to visualise.
<Genoce> Now, with armor, we could do a similar model. The 'grades' of armor aren't quite as 
neat as the weapon dice.
<Genoce> But it's possible to break down into a number of basic, no-frills pieces of armor and 
then make ones with special abilities available at a higher cost.
* eldersphinx would favor tweaking the armor lists so that Arm and MArm stats increased in 
jumps of 8 - 12 points per piece...
<Genoce> We can increase the armor stats *if* we drop the Level bonus.
<eldersphinx> The Level bonus to armor never made that much sense to me, anyway...
<Genoce> That way, the level of armor stays about the same, the armor model is more realistic, 
and armor is worth the money.
<Genoce> Best possible solution, surely?
<Jeff[Break]> All this new terminology is necessary?
*** Jeff[Break] is now known as Jeff
<Genoce> What terminology?
<Jeff> Ie, Status+, etc.
<Jeff> Slow Action/Fast Action being my personal favorites.
<Genoce> It's there for a reason. 
<Genoce> Remember the old weapon tables?
<Genoce> The ones with three or four different ways of describing the exact same thing?
<Jeff> Yes. I realize that not all of it was a bad idea.
<Genoce> The Slow/Fast/Reaction system also has its points. 
<Genoce> Take, for example, Reaction Abilities.
<Genoce> Let's say somebody attacks a character with Counter.
<Genoce> The character Counters.
<Genoce> Now the target has a Counter of their own. Do they counterattack?
<Ixquic> No.
<Genoce> Obviously. Otherwise, you'd be sitting there all day. 
<Genoce> So you could say 'Counter can only be used once' or 'Counter cannot be used 
against [ability x]'.
<Genoce> *Or* you can say 'Reaction Abilities cannot be used in response to other Reaction 
Abilities', and remove any doubt from the matter.
<Jeff> This is true.
<Genoce> Or the famous Class/Aspect system.
<Genoce> We recently had the following question on our board:
<Genoce> Ok, it's probably clearly stated somewhere and I just missed it but I'm new to this 
system so give me break...anyway the question is: Does an aspect take on the abilities of the 
class, or does the aspect only get that aspect's abilities? Does a Beastmaster only get 
Beastmastery, or does he get Beastmastery and Call Animals? Does a Dark Night get Dark Sword 
only, or does he get Fighter Skill and Dark Sword?
<Hiro> This is no longer a factor with the 4 class system.
<Hiro> Since there is no Warrior job.
<Genoce> From somebody who's used to the Class/Aspect system, it might seem like an 
arbitrary change.
<Genoce> On the other hand, for somebody who's just entering the system, it'd make more 
sense.
<Genoce> Anyway. What's next on the agenda?
<eldersphinx> Damage cap discussion. If we need to have one.
<Genoce> Well, this one should be fairly simple.
<Hiro> I think we still need it.
<Genoce> So, resolution is as follows.
<Genoce> Does Gravity obey the damage cap?
<Captain_Vittles> yes
<Genoce> If yes, then there's no issue.
<Jeff> The damage cap is nice and logical.
<Angel242> Then what's the point to using Holy Explosion, when stasis sword does as much 
damage?
<Jeff> Stasis Sword is 25% extra damage.
<Angel242> No, it's 150%
<Jeff> Holy Explosion is 200%.
<Ixquic> At level 60, It's possible.
<Angel242> I have, for damage listings...150, 160, 170, 180, 200. Not including affinity
<Jeff> Well, if we remove it...
<Jeff> Quadra Slice finishes off bosses single handedly.
<Jeff> <Swordsmaster> "Alright, Haste me and sit back. *whack* *whack* *whack* *whack*."
<Angel242> News flash people...20 strength, just plain old stasis sword=1417 damage at leve l99.
<Genoce> Anyway. What is it, Adam?
<Ixquic> Fighter. While everyone seems content with my writeup for the most part, there seems 
to be one topic being debated. Rifles. Should Fighters be able to use them, or should we leave 
that up to the GM to decide?
<Genoce> That's a 'no'.
<eldersphinx> Given that whether Rifles exist in the -campaign world- is a GM call to start with...
* Genoce nods.
<Ixquic> Alright then. No Rifles for Fighter.
<Hiro> IMO, unless it's a relatively modern or high-tech world, nobody but Engineers should have 
them.
*** killerb255 has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hey, Brandon.
<killerb255> Hey
<Ixquic> Howdy.
*** Demonic_Gerbil has joined #Returners
<Demonic_Gerbil> Howdy.
<Genoce> Hi.
<killerb255> So Rodger, what do you have so far with your new-and-improved Geomancer?
<eldersphinx> A dead Muse, mostly... :(
<Hiro> The number of dice rolls for it need to go down, for one.
<Hiro> That's all, IMO, it really needs badly.
<killerb255> How many die rolls does it have to use on average?
<Hiro> You have to roll for Magic%... then you have to roll for level... then for the effect.
<Hiro> And then damage.
<eldersphinx> It also needs more high-end powers, IMHO. The current writeup has a bunch of 8d6 
attacks and nothing.
<killerb255> ...a lot of the old writeup was also SSDD, as not all of the effects inflicted statuses.
<killerb255> ...to differentiate between terrain.
<eldersphinx> The Level and Effect rolls will be combined, at the very least, but it may be possible to 
build that into the Magic% roll as well...
<killerb255> ...or maybe just forget Magic%, and just use 1d8?
<killerb255> ...as the Geomancer doesn't have anything too terribly overpowering to justify chances 
to miss?
<killerb255> Sure, if it had 10 and 11d6 attacks, sure, but their most powerful attacks are 8d6.
<Ixquic> 8d6, while nothing to sneeze at, is not much.
<Genoce> Technically, neither is Fira. 
<Genoce> But a Black Mage still has to roll for it.
<eldersphinx> The Geomancer -should- likely have 10d6 attacks, though.
<killerb255> Even the highest Samurai Draw Out can do more than that.
<Genoce> But the Draw Outs also have a chance of failure.
<Lucas> We want to increase damage.
<killerb255> Ok, then, let's start from scratch: we have two objectives with the Geomancer:
<killerb255> 1) Increase damage.
<killerb255> 2) Reduce die rolls.
<killerb255> ...ok, 3.
<killerb255> 3) Eliminate redundancy between terrains.
<Genoce> Overlap, more appropriately.
<Genoce> And 4) Add more variety. I think Rodger mentioned that.
<killerb255> The Geomancer has nothing more than a 2d6, 4d6, 6d6, and an 8d6 attack, regardless of 
whether he's standing on a building or in a pile of cow flop.
<killerb255> ...and not all of the effects have statuses to differentiate.
<Genoce> Just say that Geomancy requires a *significant* amount of terrain to use.
<killerb255> In other words, and I know it can change, but as the Geomancer stands now: what's the
 purpose of having different terrain if you're just going to do the same thing?
<eldersphinx> And the answer to how is: Elemental affinities (we have nine), different Statuses (twelve 
or more), 
different areas of effect (four), different beneficial Status effects (several), potentially different damage 
codes...
*** Jared has joined #returners
<Genoce> Hi, Jared.
<Genoce> Playtests prove bosses are too fragile.
<killerb255> Exactly.
<Ixquic> I talked about covering this earlier, Brandon.
<Genoce> So we go with four times the HP for bosses and six times the HP for super bosses/what have 
you.
<Hiro> Which is prolly why they're getting x2, x4, and x6 HP now.
<killerb255> I think the MCS was made in mind a solo character or a group of two characters fighting 
whatever is 
generated out of it.
<Jared> If one has six characters allayed against him (really, what tabletop GM is going to make half his 
players sit on their duffs while the other half does all the adventuring?)  Their HP can go down damn fast.
<Hiro> And x2 for minibosses.
<Genoce> Right.
<Genoce> Yeah, but you're supposed to crank up the Level if the party is larger than 4.
<eldersphinx> M: Large groups of characters are always going to have a better time against single bosses 
than small groups of characters. I'd suggest a sliding scale for boss HP - x(number of opponents) for normal 
bosses, 
x(number of opponents *1.5) for super bosses.
<eldersphinx> Going back to the Geomancer, one more question.
<eldersphinx> We have three canon sources for Geomancer powers - FF5 Job, FF6 Mog, FFT Job. Which 
ones should Geomancer powers be based on?
<Ixquic> A mixture of the tree.
<eldersphinx> I'm in favor of a five-power string for each terrain - combine the one power from FFT and the 
four FF6 powers where possible, sub in the FF5 powers to fill any holes (for instance, no Building dances in 
FF6). Any objections?
<Genoce> None.
<Jared> Nope.
<Captain_Vittles> notta
<killerb255> None here.  That makes 2d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, and 10d6 with some varying effects.
<eldersphinx> I also intend to start most powers with 3d6... in line with the new magic effects.
<Hiro> I don't think the extra 1d6 will do much trouble.
<killerb255> So will a d10 roll be what governs which power comes out, or will Magic% be?
<eldersphinx> Brandon: Not sure yet. I may leave it with a random roll, I may base the power effect on the 
Magic% roll...
<killerb255> ...I don't have the writeup.
<killerb255> ...and the penalties for each: -4, -8, -12, -16, and -20?
<eldersphinx> I've got Elisha's writeup, I'll look it over.
<killerb255> ...and I'd also start with having only up to the Level 3's available early, as the Geomancer needs 
some reason to level up.
<Ixquic> the good thing about Mog's Dances is a ton of them had healing effects.
<Captain_Vittles> Make it based on FFT.  Wherever the Geomancer stands, that's what they use.
<eldersphinx> ... I'll write up assuming that we're going with a Geomancy table that uses random 
power selection, and we can tweak as needed. It's going to have random power selection *or* 
Initiative penalties - not both.
<killerb255> That's true.  Random mechanics tend to upset any need for Initiative Penalties.
<Captain_Vittles> It's the whole "one penalty only" rule.  Only summoners take 2 penalties.
*** Lumaga has joined #returners
<Lumaga> wow, full house
<eldersphinx> BTW, question on Summons. If they don't use a Magic% roll, how do we use CoS summons 
in R&E?
<Genoce> Most Sundays generally are, Matt.
<eldersphinx> Adam: Well, suppose you summon Siren to cause Silence. Take a -10% Init penalty and pay 
50 MP, right? Make no Magic% roll, because it's a Summon. Now Silence generally has a (Magic%-15)-MDef 
to take effect, right? How does that work for Siren's power?
<Captain_Vittles> Status summons should be subjected to (Magic%-modifier)-MDEF, just like a status spell.
<killerb255> Status *anything* should be subjected to that.
<killerb255> ...unless otherwise stated.
<killerb255> In other words, I guess its safe to say, in the FFRPG, if it uses MP, it's magic.
<Captain_Vittles> Leave it for later, when we can do some serious magic combat testing.
<killerb255> As it stands now, Job powers always hit, unless they're status-related or special cases (Steal, 
Break, etc.)
<Hiro> Right.
<Captain_Vittles> So a Paladin could use Holy Explosion every round, and all he pays is time?
<Hiro> Yes.
<Captain_Vittles> Whereas a mage pays time (the round itself), MP and a chance to miss?
<killerb255> Mages don't pay time, as they don't have Initiative penalties (Summoners being the exception).
<Captain_Vittles> They still use the round for their turn.  Paladins and Mages both spend the time.  Paladins 
go later but always hit.  Mages go immediately, spend MP and may miss.
<killerb255> Magic uses Magic%, other Job powers always hit.
<Genoce> Though not always their intended target.
<Captain_Vittles> Well, for now we'll leave it as it is.
<killerb255> ...it can change upon a comparison playtest or something.
<Captain_Vittles> Like I said, heavy duty magic combat testing is needed.
<Captain_Vittles> Actually, I just wanna see if Magic% causes more misses than hits.
<Captain_Vittles> If not, then I don't care how often Paladins can use Holy Sword.
<eldersphinx> So a question on Paladin-like powers - do they do too much damage? I mean, look at their first 
power, Stasis Sword. Half again normal damage, a Holy affinity, a flat (no MDef allowed) chance to Slow the 
target, and area effect. All for -2 Init.
<Captain_Vittles> 150% is ludicrous
<Captain_Vittles> Area effect + element + status = more than enough
<eldersphinx> I mean, knock it down to normal damage and single-target, and it'd probably still be a bargain 
as a useful ranged, Holy-element attack.
<killerb255> ...and they get it at Level 5.
<killerb255> If anything needed to be changed, just tone down Stasis Sword (and maybe Black Wave) to 130%.
<Captain_Vittles> 125%  :p
<Captain_Vittles> Easier to calculate
<Genoce> 25, 50, 75, 100.
<eldersphinx> Even better. 120, 140, 160, 180, 200.
<Captain_Vittles> 0, 25, 50, 75, 100
<Ixquic> I move for a vote. Let's settle this here and now.
<Ixquic> Rodger's idea versus Blair's on Holy Sword.
<Genoce> OK, I'm throwing in for Blair.
<Angel242> If I can't keep the status quo, I'm better off with Rodger than Blair
<eldersphinx> I'm voting for Blair's numbers.
<Captain_Vittles> I vote for myself as well
<Ixquic> Rodger.
<killerb255> I'll agree with it.
<Lumaga> i vote blair
<Ixquic> 5-2.
<Ixquic> Motion carried.
<Genoce> OK, guess we have a resolution. 
<Genoce> What's next on the agenda?
<Genoce> Sunday.
<Genoce> A double-feature playtest over the weekend would be ideal.
<Genoce> We really need the time.
<Captain_Vittles> Im tweeking my monster, but can't promise anything yet.
<eldersphinx> Saturday is the Level 30 magic playtest. I'm running it. Sunday may potentially be Blair's baby.
<Ixquic> We need a new Barbarian released. The new Samurai and Geomancers written up. And mucho 
playtesting is needed.
<Genoce> OK. So we'll have a To Be Confirmed for Sunday. 
<Captain_Vittles> OK, I'll tentatively say I can do it.  As I really don't have anything concrete next weekend.
<Ixquic> I can take over Sunday if Blair goes MIA, I guess.
<Hiro> A November is looking really unlikely. We'll be lucky if it's ready by Christmas.
<killerb255> M and I figured that much yesterday, Rob. :)
<Genoce> And in January FFX comes out.
<Captain_Vittles> Level 65, 65000 gil.
<Captain_Vittles> One artifact, must be approved by me
*** Captain_Vittles is now known as Amy`
<Amy`> Oh!  For the benefit of those present, I'll tell you the currently taken but maybe availble artifacts.
<Amy`> Ribbon, Minerva Plate, Save the Queen, Excalibur, Wing Edge, ... something else
<Amy`> Rob - is the Hero Ring an artifact?
<Amy`> Hero Ring is taken
<Amy`> Save the Queen will probably open up, as that's Mike's weapon.  But I may use it for my back-up 
NPCs.
<killerb255> ...I'm thinking about withdrawing my addition of Swallows to the Thief, as, although they're a 
canon Thief weapon, they're pretty damn big...
<Genoce> That's why you need Polearms Skill to use them.
<killerb255> ...however, d8 damage x 2 may be some trouble, as that would be the single most powerful weapon.
<Amy`> It's 2 separate attacks
<Amy`> One could miss
<killerb255> Never mind, I see where it says it now.
<Amy`> Axes are too weird for sword magic, agreed?
<Angel242> If you call it sword magic, yeah. But if you call it weapon magic...
<Amy`> So for sword magic - Swords, 2H Swords, Katana, Knives and Ninja Knives?
<killerb255> Right now, what I'm doing with the Master Skill list is to rank each one from 1 through 10, 10 
being the most useful.  I'm not sure how helpful this will be in solving our Skill problems, but I think it would be 
a start.
<killerb255> Example: Cooking = 3 Climbing = 9
<Genoce> Hey, any objections if we run through the Skills now?
<Genoce> And everybody throws in their numbers?
<Genoce> We might as well take advantage while we've got the chance.
<Jared> Sabin, Tifa and Amarant relied on weapons for their attacking power, and Yang and the FFT monks 
could pummel you senseless while barehanded.  Are there rules for unarmed combat by monks?  
<Galen> Yes. Wearing gloves. :)
<killerb255> The thing is, each Monk/Black Belt can either go barefisted OR use weapons (FF3j being the 
exception).
<Genoce> I have rules for brawling somewhere in the archives.
<Genoce> Buried in one of my 'let's cram as many things into one post as possible' posts.
<Genoce> Gloves being the standard 'unarmed' weapon.
* Genoce waves off.
<Ixquic> Peace, Gentlemen.
<Genoce> Last one out turn off the lights.
